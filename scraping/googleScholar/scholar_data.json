                "description": "This article details a procedure for classifying service cases with various priority levels based on machine learning (ML). It accurately defines the priority level of each service case. The presence of imbalanced datasets in service cases poses a challenge for achieving reliable classification accuracy. To address this, the use of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was proposed as the method for balancing the datasets prior to applying the ML method. From these experimental results, an improvement in the precision of the learning process was observed, which led to better outcomes in the test sets. This improvement was measured using the efficiency metrics from the confusion matrix. The experiment involved 6,182 service cases, categorized into four levels: critical, serious, moderate, and low. These were based on test comparisons with other ML methods. The accuracy achieved in the test data was 94.37%. By employing a hybrid technique to address the imbalance in SMOTE and the support vector machine model, it was found to be more effective than the comparative term frequency-inverse document frequency model that was used in conjunction with cosine similarity, which achieved an evaluation score of 70.14%."

If the prediction can give a yield close to the actual demand, the electricity suppliers can save their construction costs and provide their customers with a lower cost of electricity. However, accurate predictions still require improvement. This work, therefore, presented the predicting problem using a modified artificial emotional neural network (AENN) based on an improved JAYA optimizer. This study also applied extreme learning machine (ELM) to compute the expanded feature in the AENN. A real case study of Thailand’s power peak demand was considered, which was prepared using a rolling mechanism, to demonstrate the performance of a developed predicting model when contrasted with state-of-the-art of AENN models, artificial neural network with Levenberg-Marquardt, AENN methods based on winner-take-all approach, and improved brain emotional learning-based AENN model. Performance analyses demonstrated that the proposed model provided improvements in performance and generalized stability over the comparative models."

A new structural tolerance OS-ELM (STOS-ELM), based on the Householder block exact inverse QRD recursive least squares algorithm having numerical robustness is proposed. Experimental results conducted on four regressions and five classification problems showed that STOS-ELM can handle the situation when the network is constructed with an improper number of hidden nodes.

Many methods such as BP-MLL, rank-SVM, and MLRBF have been proposed for multi-label classification but their learning abilities are too slow. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a well known algorithm for SLFNs that can learn faster than the traditional gradient-base neural networks and it also provides better generalization performance. However, the classification performance of ELM involving multi-label classification may not be good enough despite its advantage in fast training. Therefore, this paper proposes two multi-label classification approaches in ELM. The first approach uses the 1-norm regularized Least-square for Canonical Correlation Analysis (1-norm LSCCA) to obtain the projection vectors, which in turn uses the vectors to provide the new information.

Part Separating algorithm (PS) feature extraction integrated into Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier could not demonstrate general results. The performance of SVM combined with PS was high only in Family Sphingdae of Order Lepidoptera but its accuracy rate may be dropped when used for classifying in other families. Therefore, this paper applied Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) having PS as the feature extraction process for AII for the butterfly family identification of Order Lepidoptera. In the pattern recognition process of image processing, the recognition ability of ELM classification with various activation functions and SVM were also investigated and compared. The experimental results showed that the classification in ELM using five insect features via the PS algorithm can be improved the as well as the ability to generalize every butterfly family of ELM performance, showing higher recognition rates than the SVM method in every family of order Lepidoptera."

It accurately defines the priority level of each service case. The presence of imbalanced datasets in service cases poses a challenge for achieving reliable classification accuracy. To address this, the use of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was proposed as the method for balancing the datasets prior to applying the ML method. From these experimental results, an improvement in the precision of the learning process was observed, which led to better outcomes in the test sets. This improvement was measured using the efficiency metrics from the confusion matrix. The experiment involved 6,182 service cases, categorized into four levels: critical, serious, moderate, and low. These were based on test comparisons with other ML methods. The accuracy achieved in the test data was 94.37%. By employing a hybrid technique to address the imbalance in SMOTE and the support vector machine model, it was found to be more effective than the comparative term frequency-inverse document frequency model that was used in conjunction with cosine similarity, which achieved an evaluation score of 70.14%."

They provide people with the ability to write reviews about their experience with respect to service quality, location, room, and cleanliness, thereby helping others before booking hotels. Many people fail to consider hotel bookings because the numerous reviews take a long time to read, and many are in a non-native language. Thus, hotel businesses need an efficient process to analyze and categorize the polarity of reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. In particular, low-resource languages such as Thai have greater limitations in terms of resources to classify sentiment polarity. In this paper, a sentiment analysis method is proposed for Thai sentiment classification in the hotel domain. Firstly, the Word2Vec technique (the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram approaches) was applied to create word embeddings of different vector dimensions. Secondly, each word embedding model was combined with deep learning (DL) models to observe the impact of each word vector dimension result. We compared the performance of nine DL models (CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, Bi-GRU, CNN-LSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-GRU, and CNN-BiGRU) with different numbers of layers to evaluate their performance in polarity classification. The dataset was classified using the FastText and BERT pre-trained models to carry out the sentiment polarity classification. Finally, our experimental results show that the WangchanBERTa model slightly improved the accuracy, producing a value of 0.9225, and the skip-gram and CNN model combination outperformed other …"

Thus, in sentiment analysis, it becomes difficult to identify and analyze both positive and negative reviews. Thai is a low-resource language with few resources with which to conduct NLP research and the lack of a sentiment corpus. The main objective of this paper is to present a framework in which to construct a Thai sentiment corpus and sentiment polarity classification utilizing the cosine similarity technique. The proposed framework consists of three main steps: data collection; data preprocessing; and sentiment similarity measurement. Initially, data collection generates a sub-step that is a manual sentiment that classifies polarity into positive and negative. Data preprocessing is then applied.

In conventional parametric speech synthesis, F0 is predicted frame-by-frame. This method is insufficient to represent F0 contours in larger units, especially tone contours of syllables in tonal languages that deviate as a result of long-term context dependency. This work proposes a syllable-level F0 model that represents F0 contours within syllables, using syllable-level F0 parameters that comprise the sampling F0 points and dynamic features. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) was used to represent the relationships between syllable-level contextual features and syllable-level F0 parameters. The proposed model was examined using an Isarn speech synthesis system with both large and small training sets. For all training sets, the results of objective and subjective tests indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline systems based on hidden Markov models and DNNS that predict F0 values at the frame level."

Sampled values of F0 are used at the syllable level of continuous Isarn speech combined with their dynamic features to represent supra-segmental properties of the F0 contour. Different architectures of the deep RNNs and different combinations of linguistic features are analyzed to obtain conditions for the best performance. To assess the proposed method, we compared it with several RNN-based baselines.

The compressed data is padded. After that, the size of the compressed data is further reduced by using continued fraction. Double-compressed data is, then, used as an input of RSA. When using a combination of continued fraction and LZW algorithm, the results showed that, on average, the input data length is increased by 18.91 per cent. In most cases, the processing time is much better than not doing any compression. In the case of decryption, a cipher text is decrypted by RSA first. The padding is removed.

To overcome these problems, we developed an Isarn Dharma character cluster–(IDCC) based statistical model and affixation and integrated it with the named entity recognition method (IDCC-C-based statistical model and affixation with named entity recognition (NER)). This method integrates the IDCC-based and character-based statistical models to distinguish the word boundaries.

We present, herein, a Thai finger-spelling sign language recognition system (TFSLR) used to classify alphabets shown in similar gestures. Five signers postured fifteen Thai alphabet characters, in which images were taken in five repetitions, totaling 375 finger-spelling images. Our experiment utilizes five-fold cross-validation in order to evaluate the projected system effectiveness. Additionally, we compared the results of each experiment involving PHOG with the amalgamation of PHOG and the local features.

The introduction to novel protocols and their improvements, especially for energy consumption awareness, were due to the major limitations of power-aware tiny sensor nodes. To utilize an overall energy consumption prolonging system lifetime, clustering is one of the promising approaches. By grouping sensors together, the sensor communicates only to its cluster head before gathered, and then forwarded to a base station. In this paper, we evaluate this issue, and then propose an optimization over a well-known hierarchical routing protocol, LEACH, by considering Moving energy window Average and selection Probability (MAP), resulting in an overall energy usage …"

Thus, in this research, a novel architecture to aid patients to be with caretakers wherever and whenever they are is proposed. This research describes instruments and components of the key design of the architecture including a continuous monitoring module integrating ECG measurement units with RF (Bluetooth) transmission module embedded in an easy-to-use openplatform mobile phone for relaying the signal to ECG recognition systems. The mobile system can interact with mobile doctors, patient’s relatives or even volunteers as well as emergency units, especially to deliver patient condition information and GPS location for further professional aids. In addition, to reduce the false alarm of ECG recognition, we proposed the hybrid scheme applying additional features extracted over a traditional wavelet transform technique resulting in a high recognition precision with PNN classification based on a well-known MIT-BIH arrhythmia database."

Recent successes of convolutional neural networks (CNN) have revolutionized image classification in computer vision. The outstanding convolution layer of CNN performs feature extraction to obtain promising features from images. However, it faces the overfitting problem and computational complexity due to the complicated structure of the convolution layer and deep computation. Therefore, this research problem is challenging. This paper proposes a novel deep feature extraction method based on a cellular automata (CA) model for image classification. It is established on the basis of a deep learning approach and multilayer CA with two main processes. Firstly, in the feature extraction process, multilayer CA with rules are built as the deep feature extraction model based on CA theory. The model aims at extracting multilayer features, called feature matrices, from images. Then, these feature matrices are used to generate score matrices for the deep feature model trained by the CA rules. Secondly, in the decision process, the score matrices are flattened and fed into the fully connected layer of an artificial neural network (ANN) for classification. For performance evaluation, the proposed method is empirically tested on BreaKHis, a popular public breast cancer image dataset used in several promising and popular studies, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the better results up to 7.95% improvement on average when compared with the state-of-the-art …"

                "description": "Classification is an important task of machine learning for solving a wide range of problems in conforming patterns. In the literature, machine learning algorithms dealing with non-conforming patterns are rarely proposed. In this regard, a cellular automata-based classifier (CAC) was proposed to deal with non-conforming binary patterns. Unfortunately, its ability to cope with high-dimensional and complicated problems is limited due to its applying a traditional genetic algorithm in rule ordering in CAC. Moreover, it has no mechanism to cope with ambiguous and inconsistent decision tables. Therefore, a novel proposed algorithm, called a cellular automata-based classifier with a variance decision table (CAV), was proposed to address these limitations. Firstly, we apply a novel butterfly optimization, enhanced with a mutualism scheme (m-MBOA), to manage the rule ordering in high dimensional and complicated problems. Secondly, we provide the percent coefficient of variance in creating a variance decision table, and generate a variance coefficient to estimate the best rule matrices. Thirdly, we apply a periodic boundary condition in a cellular automata (CA) boundary scheme in lieu of a null boundary condition to improve the performance of the initialized process. Empirical experiments were carried out on well-known public datasets from the OpenML repository. The experimental results show that the proposed CAV model significantly outperformed the compared CAC model and popular classification methods."

                "description": "Attribute reduction, also called feature selection, is one of the most important issues of rough set theory, which is regarded as a vital preprocessing step in pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. Nowadays, high-dimensional mixed and incomplete data sets are very common in real-world applications. Certainly, the selection of a promising feature subset from such data sets is a very interesting, but challenging problem. Almost all of the existing methods generated a cover on the space of objects to determine important features. However, some tolerance classes in the cover are useless for the computational process. Thus, this article introduces a new concept of stripped neighborhood covers to reduce unnecessary tolerance classes from the original cover. Based on the proposed stripped neighborhood cover, we define a new reduct in mixed and incomplete decision tables, and then design an …"

                "description": "Classification has been successfully applying in problems in a variety of fields, such as science, business, engineering, and industry. Unfortunately, the classifier coping with nonconforming binary patterns are rare. To deal with nonconforming pattern in binary Cellular Automata-based Classifier (CAC) had been proposed. However, CAC faces several limitations that need to improve. First, the rule ordering process in CAC which used Genetic Algorithm (GA) is unable to handle high dimensional complex problems. Second, finding decision boundaries is quite rough when dealing with ambiguous data. To deal with these problems, therefore, we propose a new classifier, called Cellular Automata-Based Classifier with Soft Decision (CAS). We replace the GA with the promising optimization algorithm, called Butterfly Optimization, for the rule ordering process. Subsequently, we improve the classification performance by augmenting a Soft-Decision step. This Soft-Decision step uses the pruning method to create a soft decision table, which efficiently serves for filtering useless data. Finally, to verify the classification performance of the proposed method, ten datasets consisting of conforming and nonconforming patterns are experimented in comparison with the promising classifiers including CAC, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Deep Learning using K-fold cross-validation. In this regard, CAS provides the promising results."

Then, the score matrices were generated as the model in which was trained by the cellular automata rules.

To model BBN, SET index distribution is discretized using a number of clustering techniques for comparison. Then, BBN is constructed using the transforming data in a P\/E ratio via the K2 algorithm based on the training dataset gathered from January 2013 through July 2019. For performance evaluation, the proposed model was compared with the statistical forecasting algorithms using RMSE and the correlation coefficient (CC).

However, FOA has a low success rate and a slow convergence, because FOA generates new positions around the best location, using a fixed search radius. Several improved FOAs have been proposed. However, their exploration ability is questionable. To make the search process smooth, transitioning from the exploration phase to the exploitation phase, this paper proposes a new FOA, constructed from a cooperation of the multileader and the probabilistic random walk strategies (CPFOA). This involves two population types working together. CPFOAs performance is evaluated by 18 well-known standard benchmarks. The results showed that CPFOA outperforms both the original FOA and its variants, in terms of convergence speed and performance accuracy. The results show that CPFOA can achieve a very promising accuracy, when compared with the well-known competitive algorithms. CPFOA is applied to optimize twoapplications: classifying the real datasets with multilayer perceptron and extracting the parameters of a very compact TS fuzzy system to model the Box and Jenkins gas furnace data set. CPFOA successfully find parameters with a very high quality, compared with the best known competitive algorithms."

The proposed method finds a candidate solution based on quality criteria using subset searching. In this study, the competitive swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm was implemented to solve feature selection problems in high-dimensional data. A new asymmetric chaotic function was proposed and used to generate the population and search for a CSO solution. Its histogram is right-skewed. The proposed method is named an asymmetric chaotic competitive swarm optimization algorithm (ACCSO). According to the asymmetrical property of the proposed chaotic map, ACCSO prefers zero than one. Therefore, the solution is very compact and can achieve high classification accuracy with a minimal feature subset for high-dimensional datasets. The proposed method was evaluated on 12 datasets, with dimensions ranging from 4 to 10,304. ACCSO was compared to the original CSO algorithm and other metaheuristic algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method can increase accuracy and it reduces the number of selected features. Compared to different optimization algorithms with other wrappers, the proposed method exhibits excellent performance."

In this paper, we study the weights initialization of NN for the prediction of annual electricity consumption using the Cultural algorithm (CA), and the proposed algorithm is named as NN-CA. The NN-CA was compared to the weights initialization using the other six metaheuristic algorithms as well as the BP. The experiments were conducted on the annual electricity consumption datasets taken from 21 countries.

With the aid of technology and innovation development, logistics management must provide both proper customer support and cost reduction in the delivery of goods. This research studied the routing of goods delivery for a drinking water factory seeking the shortest route with an objective of reducing the delivery cost. We proposed a hybrid goods delivery routing algorithm. The algorithm produced from the original routing was also tested and compared with the proposed hybrid algorithm. The comparison results showed that the Ant Colony System (ACS) routing gave the best solution when compared to the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Simulated Annealing (SA) and the Tabu Search (TS). We then combined the ACS with an Iterated Local Search (ILS) and a TS. The results, when compared with the original route, indicated that the proposed Hybrid Ant Colony System Algorithm routing can reduce the distance and fuel cost by 2.24% per week, working out to approximately 887.52 baht per year. Meanwhile, it can reduce delivery time for 1 cycle from 7 days to 5 days, which can reduce labor costs by up to 46,080 baht per year.

Several modifications of HOG were proposed to resolve these issues such as the vertical histograms of oriented gradient and one that includes position and intensity with HOG; however, these methods still contain some ambiguous features. A feature selection method can exclude these ambiguous features, allowing for better classification rates and a reduction in classification times. The proposed method uses the ideal vectors of the vehicle and non-vehicles images for selecting features in dominant patterns. The segments …"

We experimented and compared the accuracies of the following popular convolutional neural network architectures: ResNeSt, MobileNet, VGG16, Transfer Learning, and EfficientNet, whose model trainings are based on the bivalve image dataset obtained from a biology laboratory. The MobileNet model that gives the highest accuracy rate by 72% is selected to be a classification model of our framework named MorphoNet. We also applied the YOLO4 object detection in the MorphoNet to detect the teeth and scars on the bivalve image. The framework can identify the bivalve class labels and detect the interesting features on the bivalve images automatically. It is an alternative tool to help the biologists in a preliminary class label identification and support the land-marking creation and morphometric analysis instead of doing it by hand."

Formal verification using colored Petri net (CPN) can be used to prove whether a designed BPMN model is frees of undesirable properties such as deadlock and unreachable task, and meets user requirements or not. Although there are many researches providing the transformation rules and frameworks for automating and verifying the CPN model, the CPN markings determination covering all execution paths is quite cumbersome. This paper proposes an automated BPMN verification framework that integrates the BPMN modeling tool and the CPN model checker together. The designed BPMN model is transformed into a CPN model and control flow graph (CFG). The CFG is used to create the execution paths and to find the interleaved activities. The interleaved activities are then considered for creating the CPN port places and markings by an applying of the branch coverage testing technique. Behaviors of the CPN model are analyzed by using a state space analysis based on the CPN model and automated markings. Our framework has been implemented as an Eclipse BPMN modeler plugin, and it is tested with the five case studies. The results show that our framework is practical. It can automate the CPN models from the BPMN model and guide the designers regarding the CPN markings determination to achieve branch coverage criteria."

                "description": "Composite web service is typically comprised of a main orchestration description written in BPEL and its associated set of simple and individual web services. A common way to test the composite web service is to execute the BPEL along with its fully implemented version of the individual web services. Unfortunately, a particular web services orchestration in BPEL is difficult to be tested beforehand alone, without the availability of the related web services. In this paper, we propose an alternative mean to verify the web services orchestration in the early stage of the high level design process using the formal verification of the BPEL and its imitated stubs, called dummy web services. In our approach, a relevant dummy web service is generated to cope with its defined WSDL and the equivalence class partitioning technique is specifically focused. Thus, the valid and invalid classes of the invocation of the web services are simulated. The simple transformation rules of the BPEL alone, without the detailed of its associated individual web services, into Colored Petri Net are proposed. The resulting Colored Petri Net of a BPEL is correctly and consistently transformed and verifiable in CPN Tool using the equivalence class partitioning technique."

The model checking procedure for the sequence diagram is cumbersome because the transformation of the sequence diagram into a formal model requires meticulous mapping rules and methods that must yield corresponding behaviors. This paper proposes the transformation of the sequence diagram into a time automate named UPPAAL. The obtained time automata model can be used to verify deadlock, undesirable properties, and the correctness of message ordering. The transformation rules and framework were experimented with case studies. The results show that the proposed transformation rules can be applied and map the sequence diagram into a UPPAL structure correctly."

                "description": "Thai word segmentation is an important method used that is in several document analysis applications. Dictionary-based techniques are popular for Thai word segmentation because of their high accuracy. However, these techniques are prone to errors, especially when some words are not in the dictionary. A solution to this problem is to add more vocabulary to the dictionary. Moreover, traditional techniques cannot be applied to segment misspelled words. Therefore, this research proposes a new Thai word segmentation method that replaces Thai letters with English letters. Replacing the English alphabet (REA) is a novel approach for generating short English character sequences using various formats with the same Thai writing structures. This approach improves the accuracy of Thai word segmentation, thus increasing the accuracy of Thai text classification and sentiment analysis. An evaluation is performed using Thai social media messages and Thai post comments on Pantip. These datasets are labeled by their sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative). The performance of the REA approach with the TF-G and RF techniques is better than that of the other methods, and the experimental results may be acceptable upon comparison with those of earlier well-known studies."

The technique applies the factors relating to suicide and attempted suicide, which are collected from medical treatment information. The proposed technique considers the probability distribution of attemptedsuicide dates of the patients in order to examine a pre-determined threshold for classifying the patients into three categories of revisit duration, ie (i) low,(ii) medium, and (iii) high. In addition, this work proposes a feature filtering method that can select a set of significance factors from the suicide and self-harm surveillance report (RP. 506S) of Khon Kaen Rajanagarindra Psychiatric hospital to perform the classification. There are 10,112 patients who had been in the services more than once. The filtering is performed before the threshold is determined using a Gaussian function. The experiment results show that the proposed technique is superior to the baseline for every learning algorithms, ie (i) k-NN,(ii) SVM,(iii) random forest and (iv) neural networks. In addition, the results obtained from random forest provide promising outcomes. The best performance (in terms of F-measure) is 91.10%, obtained from random forest."

We used a questionnaire to collect data such as gender, age and their satisfaction with persuasive messages, obtained from students at Khon Kaen University. The classification rule generation process is based on the decision tree as a classification method where the generated rules are studied and evaluated. We compared the results obtained from three algorithms. The results shown that the average classification correct rate for the ID3 was higher than the CART and the C4.5 algorithms. The best efficiency is 98.04%, 97.27%, and 96.73%, respectively."

The analysis shows that, currently, the mHealth is implemented with the public mainstream sector mainly and lacks of developmental research on technology for individual\/personal healthcare. There is a difference of factors convincing the Thai elderly since they are tied with Collectivist culture more tightly compared to the elderly in other societies. As a result, the challenge of this research is to design the user interfaces, to specify the persuasive domain, as well as to apply suitably with the elderly in Thailand to confront such problems."

Thus, this paper aims to propose Modified Fermat Factorization Version 3 (MFFV3) to increase the computation speed when compared with MFFV2.

The value of larger number in P2MFF is increased more than one in each iteration of the computation, it is usually increased by only one in MFF and MFFV2. Moreover, this method can decrease the number of times in order to compute the square root of some integers whenever we can strongly confirm that square root of these integers is not an integer by using number theory.

Drawing on the concept of common ground from Clark’s communication theory, we propose a model to investigate the varying quality and flow of online learning conversations. Our investigation centers on three discourse systems in order to isolate the effects of two functional differences: online presence of the learning material and a linking functionality. The first system, which supports parallel artifact-centered discourse, displays the learning material and its related discussion in a single window. The second system, which supports linked artifact-centered discourse, provides a bi-directional linking functionality between these two elements available in a single window. The control system, which supports conventional discourse, offers the two elements in separate windows. We conducted an experiment with 30 doctoral students enrolled in three sections of an introductory research methods seminar. A total of 30 discussion transcripts, 10 for each group, formed the basis of the data analyses. Using an integrated approach that combined content and sequential analyses, we categorized and sequentially plotted all messages. The findings demonstrate that the online presence of the learning material supports sustained discussions centered on understanding the meaning of a text. Moreover, a linking functionality promotes complex forms of interaction with the learning material and re-focuses the discussion when it digresses. We discuss the theoretical and …"

As the number of devices and the amount of data traffic increase, congestion typically occurs, resulting in degraded network performance, i.e., increased packet losses and delays with decreased energy efficiency. Many parameters relating to congestion behaviors have been considered and dynamically changed, as have the possible transmission paths either within a single destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DoDAG) or across different DoDAGs. Thus, this research investigates congestion mitigation methods for RPL-IoT networks based on a fuzzy logic system (FLS) by proposing a novel FLS scheme to determine the selection criteria for conducting path management in three FLS components: (1) inside …"

Nevertheless, when radio transmissions between sensor nodes are obstructed (as simulated by the radio irregularity model), the signal-strength variation tends to be high, reducing localization accuracy; thus, we provide a method for accurately approximating the distances between pairs of an anchor node (whose location is known) and an unknown node by incorporating the related error into the approximation process.

However, Thailand still lacks analysis and prediction tools required to prepare for future epidemic situations. Therefore, we present development models for predicting the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the application of a long short-term memory (LSTM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was investigated to predict new cases, total cases, new deaths, and total deaths. There are a total of 77 provinces in Thailand. The data used in this trial were obtained from the Department of Disease Control (DDC) of the Thai government. The modeling employed 2 types of data: dynamic (time series) and static. There were 2 phases: 1) the LSTM was used to manipulate time series data and 2) the MLP model was used to manipulate static data. Then, the models were merged for further analysis. We evaluated the performance of the combined model, yielding an accuracy of 99.72% based on R 2 values, higher than the values obtained for state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the prediction results can be further combined with GIS data in each province and displayed via an easy-to-use web application for mapping."

This paper proposes a process for designing optimal oblivious routing that is programmed compactly on programmable switches. The process consists of three contributions in tandem. We first transform a robust optimization problem for designing oblivious routing into a linear program, which is solvable in polynomial time but cannot scale for datacenter topologies. We then prove that the repeated structures in a datacenter topology lead to a structured optimal solution. We use this insight to formulate a scalable linear program, so an optimal oblivious routing solution is obtained in polynomial time for large-scale topologies.

To overcome this drawback, many techniques have been proposed, such as optimal power allocation and interference cancellation.

Machine learning can be used to predict learning success based on how people learn in MOOCs. Predicting the learning performance can promote learning through various methods, such as identifying low-performance students or by grouping students together. Recent machine learning has enabled the development of predictive models, and the ensemble method can assist in reducing the variance and bias errors associated with single-machine learning. This study uses a two-phase classification model with an ensemble technique to predict the learners’ grades. In the first phase, binary classification is used, and the non-majority class is then sent to the second phase, which is multi-class classification. The new features are computed based on the distance from the class’s center. The distance between the data and the center of an overlapping cluster is calculated using silhouette score-based feature selection. Lastly, Bayesian optimization boosts the performance by fine tuning the optimal parameter set. Using data from the HMPC- and the CNPC datasets, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed design, the two-phase ensemble-based method, outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms."

The proposed system incorporates all four stakeholders, including supply chain (SC) participants, the food safety regulatory system, the admin, and end customers, into one chain. In the proposed TSPR system, individual components are developed to provide primarily product traceability events, product recall data and status, which are stored in the blockchain to authorized stakeholders. Moreover, the entity relationship and activity diagram of the TSPR system are developed. In the experiment, three smart contracts of the TSPR system are developed using Remix IDE running on an Ethereum test network. A scenario of the …"

Although they perform impressively in memorizing the information, their literacy and reading capability still appear to be weak since they lack the chance to revise by listening and practicing repetitively. Currently, the teaching media for deaf students are quite rare and inadequate, forcing them to face difficulties in integrating new knowledge, even though most of the contents are in a form of written, printed, downloaded, or even accessible via an e-learning platform. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that each learner is different. There is evidence showing that some learners prefer particular methods of learning, also known as learning preferences or learning styles. Thus, the present study reports the sequence of learning styles obtained by using a modified VRK + TSL model that categorized students based on their learning styles. We also propose four different ways of teaching using content-adaptive learning styles, namely visual, reading\/writing, kinesthetic, and Thai sign language. Based on personal preferences and the principle of universal design under synthesized learning, an e-learning model was developed to identify deaf learners’ learning styles. The objective is to provide e-learning to identify the learning styles of hearing-impaired students and to respond with up-to-date e-learning materials that can be used anywhere and at any time. These materials must support the education of deaf students. As a result, learners have increased efficiency and increased learning outcomes. "

Data were collected from students with hearing disabilities (Grades 7–9) studying at special schools in Khon Kaen and Udon Thani, Thailand. This research used six classification algorithms with data being resynthesized and improved via the application of feature selection, and the imbalanced data corrected using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. The collection of data from deaf students was evaluated using a 10-fold validation. This revealed that the multi-layer perceptron algorithm yields the highest accuracy. These research results are intended for application in further studies involving imbalanced data problems."

In this study, we attempted to classify five common species of poisonous and edible mushrooms found in Thailand, Inocybe rimosa, Amanita phalloides, Amanita citrina, Russula delica, and Phaeogyroporus portentosus, using the convolutional neural network (CNN) and region convolutional neural network (R-CNN). This study was motivated by the yearly death toll from eating poisonous mushrooms in Thailand. In this research, a method for the classification of edible and poisonous mushrooms was proposed and the testing time and accuracy of three pretrained models, AlexNet, ResNet-50, and GoogLeNet, were compared. The proposed model was found to reduce the duration required for training and testing while retaining a high level of accuracy. In the mushroom classification experiments using CNN and R-CNN, the proposed model demonstrated accuracy levels of 98.50% and 95.50%, respectively."

The production of thermo-alkali-stable and cellulase-free xylanase of the fungus was optimized in solid-state fermentation using statistical approaches. Response surface methodology (RSM) using central composite design (CCD) was employed to optimize conditions. The maximum xylanase production was observed at a 1.72% nitrogen concentration, initial pH of 10.54, initial moisture content of 74.73% and under incubation for 8 days at a temperature of 43.93 ºC. The maximum xylanase activity was evaluated at pH 11.0 and retained over 80% of the original activity within a pH range of 7.0–10.0 after incubation at 4 ºC for 24 h. In addition, the optimum temperature for xylanase activity was 80 ºC. The enzyme also retained more than 80% of its residual activity after heated at 60 ºC for 90 min. Therefore, its properties demonstrate significant promise for use in pulp bleaching for the paper industry; for which this study will be the focus of future investigation."

For the addressed problem, this study developed a matching system for pair programming. Pair programming theory believes that when an expert is paired with a beginner, it accelerates the beginner to progress more efficiently as oppose to coding alone. Nonetheless, the theory did not address the issue of programmer behavior, which is another important aspect in programming.

Data mining is one of the promising approaches to deal with large scale dataset including attack detection and recognition based on attack traces as an example from KDD CUP 1999. However, one of its key limitations is the computational complexity, and thus, this research investigates the possibility to integrate parallel processing to enhance the detection speed-up implemented on NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Several proposals have focused on kNearest Neighbour (KNN) as one of the promising approaches due to its key advantage of simplicity and high precision; however, in addition to KNN evaluation, this research also proposes the integration of a simplified neighborhood classification (Neighborhood) using the percentage instead of group ranking resulting in higher accuracy gain with insignificantly increase of computational complexity trade-off."

The designed system was based on the problem-solving model within the context of C\/C++ programming and Gagné’s nine concepts. The system was developed as an online environment. The target group was the undergraduate students who were enrolled in the Introduction to Computer Programming course in the second semester for the academic year 2013 in the Department of Computer Science, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. We investigated the impact of the system on the students’ achievement and their satisfaction with this system. This area of the research was carried out using a learning achievement test and a questionnaire using the online environment. The data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, an independent-samples T-test and a paired-samples T-test. The results of this research showed that the students’ post-test scores were significantly higher than their pretest scores at. 05 significance level. The questionnaire given at the very end of the experiment showed the satisfaction of participating students towards the system. Each question in the questionnaire showed students to be satisfied."

                "description": "This paper proposes an open architecture for animal tracking systems using an easy-to-access Arduino board equipped with various sensors built into a compact prototype, easily attached to an animal collar. With GPS and public Google Map API functionalities, global location and sensor information are sent over SMS-GSM networks to an Android OS phone embedded with a simplified RF technology used to track animals when closing by with an adaptive alert sound and bar sign for mobile monitoring and searching. In addition, to efficiently save the battery power and cost of the tracking system, a practical usage of a simple analog light sensor with motion logic is investigated, and then implemented resulting in feasibility and efficiency of battery power and data transmission."

                "description": "CODE STUDIO or Code. org is a non-profit organization and led by Hadi Partovi that aims to encourage people, particularly school students in the United States, to learn computer science on making computer programming more accessible. The website aims to promote STEM content and skill learning among participating youth through educational. It includes free coding lessons and the initiative also targets schools in an attempt to encourage them to include more computer science classes in the curriculum. On December 9, 2013, they launched the Hour of Code 2013 nationwide to promote computer science during Computer Science Education Week until December 15, 2013. However, general Thai students who are the ages of 6-18 lack of ability in English therefore, this paper aims to propose the design and develop system in Thai contents. Development tools for this system are XAMPP, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Dreamweaver, and Sublime. Then report result from implementation in the effectiveness index (E1\/E2). The participants of the study were 20 students from age of 6-18, and level of effectiveness index equals to 0.616. The questionnaire given at the very end of the experiment showed the satisfaction of participating students towards the system. Each question in the questionnaire showed students to be satisfied."

                "description": "According to a study of Mycology, Phylum Basidiomycota is the fungus which has the most complex internal structure. This fungus can reproduce in two types which are sexual and asexual reproduction. The instructor usually represents the knowledge through the picture on worksheets and uses the microscope to see the explicit structure. Even though using microscope encourage learners to see the explicit structure, but not the whole life cycle because each life cycle has the time as variable. Moreover, there are many processes for study and self-learning in laboratory which are very complicated. If the learners would like to study outside the laboratory, they cannot see the real internal structure or how the life cycle is going on. In order to support learning by solving the above problem, it is very necessary to improve the system of Augmented Reality for learning Phylum Basidiomycota. This system encourages the learners to see internal structure and each cycle of Phylum Basidiomycota without using microscope. They just have to use electronic camera under the system of Augmented Reality for learning Phylum Basidiomycota. Three-dimensional virtual image created from Unity program will appear on the electronic screen by technology of Augmented Reality which will obtain the virtual image naturally. In addition, we have satisfaction survey for users to answer with its description. The system will show the score to let the learners evaluate themselves. All in all, the feedback about this system by the questionnaire reported the participating learner satisfaction in satisfy level in average is 4.5 from the Linkert scale (1-5) and most of users’ satisfaction …"
