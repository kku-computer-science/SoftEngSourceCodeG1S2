Data mining is one of the promising approaches to deal with large scale dataset including attack detection and recognition based on attack traces as an example from KDD CUP 1999. However, one of its key limitations is the computational complexity, and thus, this research investigates the possibility to integrate parallel processing to enhance the detection speed-up implemented on NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Several proposals have focused on kNearest Neighbour (KNN) as one of the promising approaches due to its key advantage of simplicity and high precision; however, in addition to KNN evaluation, this research also proposes the integration of a simplified neighborhood classification (Neighborhood) using the percentage instead of group ranking resulting in higher accuracy gain with insignificantly increase of computational complexity trade-off."

Recent successes of convolutional neural networks (CNN) have revolutionized image classification in computer vision. The outstanding convolution layer of CNN performs feature extraction to obtain promising features from images. However, it faces the overfitting problem and computational complexity due to the complicated structure of the convolution layer and deep computation. Therefore, this research problem is challenging. This paper proposes a novel deep feature extraction method based on a cellular automata (CA) model for image classification. It is established on the basis of a deep learning approach and multilayer CA with two main processes. Firstly, in the feature extraction process, multilayer CA with rules are built as the deep feature extraction model based on CA theory. The model aims at extracting multilayer features, called feature matrices, from images. Then, these feature matrices are used to generate score matrices for the deep feature model trained by the CA rules. Secondly, in the decision process, the score matrices are flattened and fed into the fully connected layer of an artificial neural network (ANN) for classification. For performance evaluation, the proposed method is empirically tested on BreaKHis, a popular public breast cancer image dataset used in several promising and popular studies, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the better results up to 7.95% improvement on average when compared with the state-of-the-art …"

                "description": "Classification is an important task of machine learning for solving a wide range of problems in conforming patterns. In the literature, machine learning algorithms dealing with non-conforming patterns are rarely proposed. In this regard, a cellular automata-based classifier (CAC) was proposed to deal with non-conforming binary patterns. Unfortunately, its ability to cope with high-dimensional and complicated problems is limited due to its applying a traditional genetic algorithm in rule ordering in CAC. Moreover, it has no mechanism to cope with ambiguous and inconsistent decision tables. Therefore, a novel proposed algorithm, called a cellular automata-based classifier with a variance decision table (CAV), was proposed to address these limitations. Firstly, we apply a novel butterfly optimization, enhanced with a mutualism scheme (m-MBOA), to manage the rule ordering in high dimensional and complicated problems. Secondly, we provide the percent coefficient of variance in creating a variance decision table, and generate a variance coefficient to estimate the best rule matrices. Thirdly, we apply a periodic boundary condition in a cellular automata (CA) boundary scheme in lieu of a null boundary condition to improve the performance of the initialized process. Empirical experiments were carried out on well-known public datasets from the OpenML repository. The experimental results show that the proposed CAV model significantly outperformed the compared CAC model and popular classification methods."

However, traditional CF methods usually cannot track temporal dynamic user preferences and topic changes to make appropriate suggestions.

Unfortunately, the classifier coping with nonconforming binary patterns are rare. To deal with nonconforming pattern in binary Cellular Automata-based Classifier (CAC) had been proposed. However, CAC faces several limitations that need to improve. First, the rule ordering process in CAC which used Genetic Algorithm (GA) is unable to handle high dimensional complex problems. Second, finding decision boundaries is quite rough when dealing with ambiguous data. To deal with these problems, therefore, we propose a new classifier, called Cellular Automata-Based Classifier with Soft Decision (CAS). We replace the GA with the promising optimization algorithm, called Butterfly Optimization, for the rule ordering process. Subsequently, we improve the classification performance by augmenting a Soft-Decision step. This Soft-Decision step uses the pruning method to create a soft decision table, which efficiently serves for filtering useless data. Finally, to verify the classification performance of the proposed method, ten datasets consisting of conforming and nonconforming patterns are experimented in comparison with the promising classifiers including CAC, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Deep Learning using K-fold cross-validation. In this regard, CAS provides the promising results."

The speckle noise contamination caused at some points in ultrasound picture acquisition systems compromises the level of its visuality, which presents a diagnostic challenge for medical doctors. Therefore, to enhance the visual quality, despeckling filters are normally employed in the processing of such pictures. However, several disadvantages have developed within current despeckling filters, which have discouraged the utilization of modern despeckling filters for minimizing impacts from speckle noise. The proposed despeckling filter was developed through a combination of an adaptive thresholding function and a cuckoo search algorithm. Specifically, the aforementioned cuckoo search algorithm …"

To make the search process smooth, transitioning from the exploration phase to the exploitation phase, this paper proposes a new FOA, constructed from a cooperation of the multileader and the probabilistic random walk strategies (CPFOA). This involves two population types working together. CPFOAs performance is evaluated by 18 well-known standard benchmarks. The results showed that CPFOA outperforms both the original FOA and its variants, in terms of convergence speed and performance accuracy. The results show that CPFOA can achieve a very promising accuracy, when compared with the well-known competitive algorithms. CPFOA is applied to optimize twoapplications: classifying the real datasets with multilayer perceptron and extracting the parameters of a very compact TS fuzzy system to model the Box and Jenkins gas furnace data set. CPFOA successfully find parameters with a very high quality, compared with the best known competitive algorithms."

The proposed method finds a candidate solution based on quality criteria using subset searching. In this study, the competitive swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm was implemented to solve feature selection problems in high-dimensional data. A new asymmetric chaotic function was proposed and used to generate the population and search for a CSO solution. Its histogram is right-skewed. The proposed method is named an asymmetric chaotic competitive swarm optimization algorithm (ACCSO). According to the asymmetrical property of the proposed chaotic map, ACCSO prefers zero than one. Therefore, the solution is very compact and can achieve high classification accuracy with a minimal feature subset for high-dimensional datasets. The proposed method was evaluated on 12 datasets, with dimensions ranging from 4 to 10,304. ACCSO was compared to the original CSO algorithm and other metaheuristic algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed method can increase accuracy and it reduces the number of selected features. Compared to different optimization algorithms with other wrappers, the proposed method exhibits excellent performance."

In this paper, we study the weights initialization of NN for the prediction of annual electricity consumption using the Cultural algorithm (CA), and the proposed algorithm is named as NN-CA. The NN-CA was compared to the weights initialization using the other six metaheuristic algorithms as well as the BP. The experiments were conducted on the annual electricity consumption datasets taken from 21 countries. The experimental results showed that the proposed NN-CA achieved more productive and better prediction accuracy than other competitors. This result indicates the possible consequences of the proposed NN-CA in the application of annual electricity consumption prediction."

The impacts of each Linnik flight usage pattern were evaluated using the CEC 2017. The experimental results showed that: 1) CS variants that used Linnik flight were more capable than CS variants that used Lévy flight and 2) CS variants that used a mixture of Linnik flight and quantum-behaved mechanisms were even more capable.

This research studied the routing of goods delivery for a drinking water factory seeking the shortest route with an objective of reducing the delivery cost. We proposed a hybrid goods delivery routing algorithm. The algorithm produced from the original routing was also tested and compared with the proposed hybrid algorithm. The comparison results showed that the Ant Colony System (ACS) routing gave the best solution when compared to the Genetic Algorithm (GA), the Simulated Annealing (SA) and the Tabu Search (TS). We then combined the ACS with an Iterated Local Search (ILS) and a TS. The results, when compared with the original route, indicated that the proposed Hybrid Ant Colony System Algorithm routing can reduce the distance and fuel cost by 2.24% per week, working out to approximately 887.52 baht per year. Meanwhile, it can reduce delivery time for 1 cycle from 7 days to 5 days, which can reduce labor costs by up to 46,080 baht per year.

However, ELM cannot handle the class imbalance. Recently, the weighted ELM was developed to solve this issue. The weighted ELM performance still faced with finding the proper boundary between positive class and negative class. In this paper, we proposed GWO-weighted ELM that is a combination of the weighted ELM integrated with the Gray wolf optimizer (GWO). The main contribution of the paper is the regularization parameter is optimized via the GWO algorithm. The experiments were conducted on 16 real imbalanced datasets. We compared the proposed GWO-weighted ELM with the original weighted ELM. The experimental results showed that the GWO-weighted ELM with Wl is superior to the weighted ELM and the GWO-weighted ELM with …"

Noise suppression is the most important consideration that cannot be ignored in image processing. In this paper, we propose a removal technique based on K-means cluster filtering in an RGB color image, while preserving image details. This K-means cluster filtering methods consists of the combination of K-means, smoothing linear, and nonlinear filtering (the noisy pel detection and the mixed noise). We address the mix of Gaussian, salt and pepper, and speckle noise.

Multilevel thresholding is a widely used technique that uses threshold values for image segmentation. However, from a computational stand point, the search for optimal threshold values presents a challenging task, especially when the number of thresholds is high. To get the optimal threshold values, a meta-heuristic or optimization algorithm is required. Our proposed algorithm is referred to as Rr-cr-IJADE, which is an improved version of Rcr-IJADE. Rr-cr-IJADE uses a newly proposed mutation strategy, “DE\/rand-to-rank\/1”, to improve the search success rate.

The MobileNet model that gives the highest accuracy rate by 72% is selected to be a classification model of our framework named MorphoNet. We also applied the YOLO4 object detection in the MorphoNet to detect the teeth and scars on the bivalve image.

Formal verification using colored Petri net (CPN) can be used to prove whether a designed BPMN model is frees of undesirable properties such as deadlock and unreachable task, and meets user requirements or not. Although there are many researches providing the transformation rules and frameworks for automating and verifying the CPN model, the CPN markings determination covering all execution paths is quite cumbersome. This paper proposes an automated BPMN verification framework that integrates the BPMN modeling tool and the CPN model checker together. The designed BPMN model is transformed into a CPN model and control flow graph (CFG). The CFG is used to create the execution paths and to find the interleaved activities. The interleaved activities are then considered for creating the CPN port places and markings by an applying of the branch coverage testing technique. Behaviors of the CPN model are analyzed by using a state space analysis based on the CPN model and automated markings. Our framework has been implemented as an Eclipse BPMN modeler plugin, and it is tested with the five case studies. The results show that our framework is practical. It can automate the CPN models from the BPMN model and guide the designers regarding the CPN markings determination to achieve branch coverage criteria."

The results show that the designed CPN model and provided simulation cases help the learners to animate, verify, trace back accounting transactions and data flows, and increase the learner’s understanding."

Owing to the lack of BPMN standard semantics, formal verification is used to validate whether the BPMN design model is free of undesirable properties. The primary challenges of BPMN design model verification are the enormous size and complexity of BPMN design models; these challenges may lead to time-consuming processes for model abstraction and overcoming the state space explosion problem. This paper proposes a hierarchical verification technique for the state space analysis based on a colored Petri net (CPN). A BPMN partitioning technique and rules for the transformation of a BPMN into a CPN model are provided.

                "description": "Composite web service is typically comprised of a main orchestration description written in BPEL and its associated set of simple and individual web services. A common way to test the composite web service is to execute the BPEL along with its fully implemented version of the individual web services. Unfortunately, a particular web services orchestration in BPEL is difficult to be tested beforehand alone, without the availability of the related web services. In this paper, we propose an alternative mean to verify the web services orchestration in the early stage of the high level design process using the formal verification of the BPEL and its imitated stubs, called dummy web services. In our approach, a relevant dummy web service is generated to cope with its defined WSDL and the equivalence class partitioning technique is specifically focused. Thus, the valid and invalid classes of the invocation of the web services are simulated. The simple transformation rules of the BPEL alone, without the detailed of its associated individual web services, into Colored Petri Net are proposed. The resulting Colored Petri Net of a BPEL is correctly and consistently transformed and verifiable in CPN Tool using the equivalence class partitioning technique."

                "description": "Thai word segmentation is an important method used that is in several document analysis applications. Dictionary-based techniques are popular for Thai word segmentation because of their high accuracy. However, these techniques are prone to errors, especially when some words are not in the dictionary. A solution to this problem is to add more vocabulary to the dictionary. Moreover, traditional techniques cannot be applied to segment misspelled words. Therefore, this research proposes a new Thai word segmentation method that replaces Thai letters with English letters. Replacing the English alphabet (REA) is a novel approach for generating short English character sequences using various formats with the same Thai writing structures. This approach improves the accuracy of Thai word segmentation, thus increasing the accuracy of Thai text classification and sentiment analysis. An evaluation is performed using Thai social media messages and Thai post comments on Pantip. These datasets are labeled by their sentiments (positive, neutral, or negative). The performance of the REA approach with the TF-G and RF techniques is better than that of the other methods, and the experimental results may be acceptable upon comparison with those of earlier well-known studies."

The technique applies the factors relating to suicide and attempted suicide, which are collected from medical treatment information. The proposed technique considers the probability distribution of attemptedsuicide dates of the patients in order to examine a pre-determined threshold for classifying the patients into three categories of revisit duration, ie (i) low,(ii) medium, and (iii) high. In addition, this work proposes a feature filtering method that can select a set of significance factors from the suicide and self-harm surveillance report (RP. 506S) of Khon Kaen Rajanagarindra Psychiatric hospital to perform the classification. There are 10,112 patients who had been in the services more than once. The filtering is performed before the threshold is determined using a Gaussian function. The experiment results show that the proposed technique is superior to the baseline for every learning algorithms, ie (i) k-NN,(ii) SVM,(iii) random forest and (iv) neural networks. In addition, the results obtained from random forest provide promising outcomes. The best performance (in terms of F-measure) is 91.10%, obtained from random forest."

Drawing on the concept of common ground from Clark’s communication theory, we propose a model to investigate the varying quality and flow of online learning conversations. Our investigation centers on three discourse systems in order to isolate the effects of two functional differences: online presence of the learning material and a linking functionality. The first system, which supports parallel artifact-centered discourse, displays the learning material and its related discussion in a single window. The second system, which supports linked artifact-centered discourse, provides a bi-directional linking functionality between these two elements available in a single window. The control system, which supports conventional discourse, offers the two elements in separate windows. We conducted an experiment with 30 doctoral students enrolled in three sections of an introductory research methods seminar. A total of 30 discussion transcripts, 10 for each group, formed the basis of the data analyses. Using an integrated approach that combined content and sequential analyses, we categorized and sequentially plotted all messages. The findings demonstrate that the online presence of the learning material supports sustained discussions centered on understanding the meaning of a text. Moreover, a linking functionality promotes complex forms of interaction with the learning material and re-focuses the discussion when it digresses. We discuss the theoretical and …"

In order to provide energy to the UAVR, we consider the hybrid simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT) method, which allows the UAVR to harvest energy from the source (i.e., sink node) signal. Herein, a hybrid time switching (TS)-based and power splitting (PS)-based relaying scheme is applied to improve the UAVR’s energy harvesting (EH) efficiency and the system performance. Given this context, we derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability (OP) for the sensors to evaluate the network performance.

Such environment settings lead to lower localization accuracy because locations are estimated based on detour distances circumventing the obstacles; we, therefore, improve the segmentation technique to address the issue as they divide the whole area into multiple smaller ones, each containing fewer or no obstacles. Nevertheless, when radio transmissions between sensor nodes are obstructed (as simulated by the radio irregularity model), the signal-strength variation tends to be high, reducing localization accuracy; thus, we provide a method for accurately approximating the distances between pairs of an anchor node (whose location is known) and an unknown node by incorporating the related error into the approximation process.

However, Thailand still lacks analysis and prediction tools required to prepare for future epidemic situations. Therefore, we present development models for predicting the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the application of a long short-term memory (LSTM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was investigated to predict new cases, total cases, new deaths, and total deaths. There are a total of 77 provinces in Thailand. The data used in this trial were obtained from the Department of Disease Control (DDC) of the Thai government. The modeling employed 2 types of data: dynamic (time series) and static. There were 2 phases: 1) the LSTM was used to manipulate time series data and 2) the MLP model was used to manipulate static data. Then, the models were merged for further analysis. We evaluated the performance of the combined model, yielding an accuracy of 99.72% based on R 2 values, higher than the values obtained for state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the prediction results can be further combined with GIS data in each province and displayed via an easy-to-use web application for mapping."

We first transform a robust optimization problem for designing oblivious routing into a linear program, which is solvable in polynomial time but cannot scale for datacenter topologies. We then prove that the repeated structures in a datacenter topology lead to a structured optimal solution.

However, cognitive NOMA networks are unstable and vulnerable because multiple devices operate on the same frequency band. To overcome this drawback, many techniques have been proposed, such as optimal power allocation and interference cancellation. In this paper, we consider an approach by which the secondary transmitter (STx) is able to find the best licensed channel to send its confidential message to the secondary receivers (SRxs) by using the NOMA technique. To combat eavesdroppers and achieve reasonable performance, a power allocation policy that satisfies both the outage probability (OP) constraint of primary users and the security …"

                "description": "MOOCs are online learning environments which many students use, but the success rate of online learning is low. Machine learning can be used to predict learning success based on how people learn in MOOCs. Predicting the learning performance can promote learning through various methods, such as identifying low-performance students or by grouping students together. Recent machine learning has enabled the development of predictive models, and the ensemble method can assist in reducing the variance and bias errors associated with single-machine learning. This study uses a two-phase classification model with an ensemble technique to predict the learners’ grades. In the first phase, binary classification is used, and the non-majority class is then sent to the second phase, which is multi-class classification. The new features are computed based on the distance from the class’s center. The distance between the data and the center of an overlapping cluster is calculated using silhouette score-based feature selection. Lastly, Bayesian optimization boosts the performance by fine tuning the optimal parameter set. Using data from the HMPC- and the CNPC datasets, the experiment results demonstrate that the proposed design, the two-phase ensemble-based method, outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms."

In this system, a secondary transmitter (ST) uses licensed spectrum from the primary network to transmit signals to its secondary receivers (SRs) based on NOMA. The UR is used as a relay to forward the signals from the ST to the SRs. As a result, the system can achieve significant improvements in spectral efficiency and network capacity. However, such a MIMO NOMA CR system faces issues of interference and security, i.e., eavesdropping attacks, due to the shared spectrum use and the UR. Therefore, we aim to minimize the outage probability of the secondary network, subject to constraints on the outage probability of the primary network and the intercept probabilities of eavesdroppers.

Although the LoRa Alliance enhanced the security and the network architecture of LoRaWAN from version 1.0 to version 1.1, the last version still faces some drawbacks such as vulnerability to attacks. Some works have assessed LoRaWAN (v1.0 and v1.1) security risks and vulnerabilities.

Although they perform impressively in memorizing the information, their literacy and reading capability still appear to be weak since they lack the chance to revise by listening and practicing repetitively. Currently, the teaching media for deaf students are quite rare and inadequate, forcing them to face difficulties in integrating new knowledge, even though most of the contents are in a form of written, printed, downloaded, or even accessible via an e-learning platform. However, it is crucial to bear in mind that each learner is different. There is evidence showing that some learners prefer particular methods of learning, also known as learning preferences or learning styles. Thus, the present study reports the sequence of learning styles obtained by using a modified VRK + TSL model that categorized students based on their learning styles. We also propose four different ways of teaching using content-adaptive learning styles, namely visual, reading\/writing, kinesthetic, and Thai sign language. Based on personal preferences and the principle of universal design under synthesized learning, an e-learning model was developed to identify deaf learners’ learning styles. The objective is to provide e-learning to identify the learning styles of hearing-impaired students and to respond with up-to-date e-learning materials that can be used anywhere and at any time. These materials must support the education of deaf students. As a result, learners have increased efficiency and increased learning outcomes. "

This research used six classification algorithms with data being resynthesized and improved via the application of feature selection, and the imbalanced data corrected using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. The collection of data from deaf students was evaluated using a 10-fold validation. This revealed that the multi-layer perceptron algorithm yields the highest accuracy.

This study was motivated by the yearly death toll from eating poisonous mushrooms in Thailand. In this research, a method for the classification of edible and poisonous mushrooms was proposed and the testing time and accuracy of three pretrained models, AlexNet, ResNet-50, and GoogLeNet, were compared. The proposed model was found to reduce the duration required for training and testing while retaining a high level of accuracy. In the mushroom classification experiments using CNN and R-CNN, the proposed model demonstrated accuracy levels of 98.50% and 95.50%, respectively."

Data mining is one of the promising approaches to deal with large scale dataset including attack detection and recognition based on attack traces as an example from KDD CUP 1999. However, one of its key limitations is the computational complexity, and thus, this research investigates the possibility to integrate parallel processing to enhance the detection speed-up implemented on NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Several proposals have focused on kNearest Neighbour (KNN) as one of the promising approaches due to its key advantage of simplicity and high precision; however, in addition to KNN evaluation, this research also proposes the integration of a simplified neighborhood classification (Neighborhood) using the percentage instead of group ranking resulting in higher accuracy gain with insignificantly increase of computational complexity trade-off."

Then, Gabor filter is applied to retrieve the key features before feeding into different soft-computing techniques to identify the actual cells. The results show that the performance of Fuzzy C-Mean with image processing optimization is outstanding compared to neural networks, genetic algorithms, and support vector machines, i.e., 96 % versus less than 90 % in precision, in addition to the superior computational time of around two seconds."

This fungus can reproduce in two types which are sexual and asexual reproduction. The instructor usually represents the knowledge through the picture on worksheets and uses the microscope to see the explicit structure. Even though using microscope encourage learners to see the explicit structure, but not the whole life cycle because each life cycle has the time as variable. Moreover, there are many processes for study and self-learning in laboratory which are very complicated. If the learners would like to study outside the laboratory, they cannot see the real internal structure or how the life cycle is going on. In order to support learning by solving the above problem, it is very necessary to improve the system of Augmented Reality for learning Phylum Basidiomycota. This system encourages the learners to see internal structure and each cycle of Phylum Basidiomycota without using microscope. They just have to use electronic camera under the system of Augmented Reality for learning Phylum Basidiomycota. Three-dimensional virtual image created from Unity program will appear on the electronic screen by technology of Augmented Reality which will obtain the virtual image naturally. In addition, we have satisfaction survey for users to answer with its description. The system will show the score to let the learners evaluate themselves.

The problems with existing approaches are typically solved using a single deep learning method, which is not robust with complex datasets, such as FER data, which have a characteristic imbalance and multi-class labels. In this research paper, an innovative approach to FER using a homogeneous ensemble convolutional neural network, called HoE-CNN, is presented for future online learning education. This paper aims to transfer the knowledge of models and FER classification using ensembled homogeneous conventional neural network architectures. FER is challenging to research because there are many real-world applications to consider, such as adaptive user interfaces, games, education, and robot integration. HoE-CNN is used to improve the classification performance on an FER dataset, encompassing seven main multi-classes (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral). The experiment shows that the proposed framework, which uses an ensemble of deep learning models, performs better than a single deep learning model. In summary, the proposed model will increase the efficiency of FER classification results and solve FER2013 at a accuracy of 75.51%, addressing both imbalanced datasets and multi-class classification to transfer the application of the model to online learning applications."

Most people spend a lot of time consuming social media every day, and it is very possible for people as social media users to receive fake news without realizing it. Primarily due to this situation, we developed a machine learning tool to detect fake news that operates with the aid of various algorithms such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naïve Bayes. Our experiement is tested based on machine learning that selected only one technique used to classify the data by finding the model set. In addition, the performance of the set describes the classification of the model and the inconsistency solution for each iteration. This study proposed a model which used the probability weighting of the model in features extraction processing for data classification. The concept is the enhancement of probability weighting features that converge exactly the class labels of classification. Our work was also implemented based on traditional Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer sentiment analysis and combined probability weighting features for fake news articles.

                "description": "Product layout significantly impacts consumer demand for purchases in supermarkets. Product shelf renovation is a crucial process that can increase supermarket efficiency. The development of a sequential pattern mining algorithm for investigating the correlation patterns of product layouts, solving the numerous problems of shelf design, and the development of an algorithm that considers in-store purchase and shelf profit data with the goal of improving supermarket efficiency, and consequently profitability, were the goals of this research. The authors of this research developed two types of algorithms to enhance efficiency and reach the goals. The first was a PrefixSpan algorithm, which was used to optimize sequential pattern mining, known as the PrefixSpan mining approach. The second was a new multi-objective design that considered the objective functions of profit volumes and closeness rating using the mutation-based harmony search (MBHS) optimization algorithm, which was used to evaluate the performance of the first algorithm based on the PrefixSpan algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the PrefixSpan algorithm can determine correlation rules more efficiently and accurately ascertain correlation rules better than any other algorithms used in the study. Additionally, the authors found that MBHS with a new multi-objective design can effectively find the product layout in supermarket solutions. Finally, the proposed product layout algorithm was found to lead to higher profit volumes and closeness ratings than traditional shelf layouts, as well as to be more efficient than other algorithms."

This algorithm can enhance the prediction efficiency of component models. However, the efficiency of combining models typically depends on the diversity and accuracy of the predicted results of ensemble models. However, the problem of multi-class data is still encountered. In the proposed approach, cost-sensitive learning was implemented to evaluate the prediction accuracy for each class, which was used to construct a cost-sensitivity matrix of the true positive (TP) rate. This TP rate can be used as a weight value and combined with a probability value to drive ensemble learning for a specified class. We proposed an ensemble model, which was a type of heterogenous model, namely, a combination of various individual classification models (support vector machine, Bayes, K-nearest neighbour, naïve Bayes, decision …"

They have well-established and growing higher education systems, increasingly focused on quality improvement. However, they fall behind regional leaders in educating people who design, develop, deploy and train data science and artificial intelligence (DS&AI) based technology, as evident from the technological market, regionally dominated by Singapore and Malaysia, while the region as a whole is far behind China. A similar situation holds also for Sri Lanka, in the South Asia region technologically dominated by India. In this paper, we describe the design of a master's level curriculum in data science and artificial intelligence using European experience on building such curricula. The design of such a curriculum is a nontrivial exercise because there is a constant trade-off between having a sufficiently broad academic curriculum and adequately meeting regional needs, including those of industrial stakeholders. In fact, findings from a gap analysis and assessment of needs from three case studies in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand comprise the most significant component of our curriculum development process."

However, existing techniques, including swarm intelligence and set theory approaches, often struggle with high-dimensional datasets due to repeated reassessment of feature selection, leading to increased processing time and computational inefficiency.Objective: This study aims to develop an enhanced incremental feature selection method that minimizes dependency on the initial dataset while improving computational efficiency. Specifically, the approach focuses on dynamic sampling and adaptive optimization to address the challenges in high-dimensional data environments.Methods: We implement a dynamic sampling approach based on rough set theory, integrating the Long-Tail Position Grey Wolf Optimizer. This method incrementally adjusts to new data samples without relying on the original dataset for feature selection, reducing variance in partitioned datasets. The performance is evaluated on benchmark datasets, comparing the proposed method to existing techniques.Results: Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of F1 score, precision, recall and computation time. The incremental adjustment and reduced dependence on the initial data improve the overall accuracy and efficiency of feature selection in high-dimensional contexts.Conclusion: This study offers a significant advancement in feature selection methods for high-dimensional datasets.

Many methods for managing imbalanced data have been studied and developed to improve data balance. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study to assess the influence of a ranking technique on the evaluation of the effectiveness of 66 traditional methods for addressing imbalanced data. The three classification models, ie, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, act as classification models. The experimental settings have been divided into two segments. The first part evaluates the performance of various imbalanced dataset handling methods, while the second part compares the performance of the top 4 oversampling methods. The study encompasses 50 separate datasets: 20 retrieved from the UCI repository and 30 sourced from the OpenML repository. The evaluation is based on F-Measure and statistical methods, including the Kruskal-Wallis test and Borda Count, to rank the data imbalance handling capabilities of the 66 methods. The SMOTE technique is the benchmark for comparison due to its popularity in handling imbalanced data. Based on the experimental results, the MCT, Polynom-fit-SMOTE, and CBSO methods were identified as the top three performers, demonstrating superior effectiveness in managing imbalanced datasets.

Anemia also has several forms, which can be distinguished based on several characteristics. It is possible to diagnose anemia through a quick, affordable, and easily accessible laboratory test known as the complete blood count (CBC), but the method cannot directly identify different kinds of anemia. Therefore, further tests are required to establish a gold standard for the type of anemia in a patient. These tests are uncommon in settings that offer healthcare on a smaller scale because they require expensive equipment. Moreover, it is also difficult to discern between beta thalassemia trait (BTT), iron deficiency anemia (IDA), hemoglobin E (HbE), and combination anemias despite the presence of multiple red blood cell (RBC) formulas and indices with differing optimal cutoff values. This is due to the existence of several varieties of anemia in individuals, making it difficult to distinguish between BTT, IDA, HbE, and combinations. Therefore, a more precise and automated prediction model is proposed to distinguish these four types to accelerate the identification process for doctors. Historical data were retrieved from the Laboratory of the Department of Clinical Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia for this purpose. Furthermore, the model was developed using the algorithm for the extreme learning machine (ELM). This was followed by the measurement of the performance using the …"

The research investigates the innovative application of machine learning models, specifically Stacked Multi-Kernel Support Vector Machines Random Forest (SMKSVM-RF), to determine their effectiveness in identifying complex patterns in medical data. The innovative ensemble learning method SMKSVM-RF combines the strengths of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs) to leverage their diversity and complementary features. The SVM component implements multiple kernels to identify unique data patterns, while the RF component consists of an ensemble of decision trees to ensure reliable predictions. Integrating these models into a stacked architecture allows SMKSVM-RF to enhance the overall predictive performance for classification or regression tasks by optimizing their strengths. A significant finding of this study is the introduction of SMKSVM-RF, which displays an impressive 73.37% accuracy rate in the confusion matrix. Additionally, its recall is 71.62%, its precision is 70.13%, and it has a noteworthy F1-Score of 71.34%. This innovative technique shows potential for enhancing current methods and developing into an ideal healthcare system, signifying a noteworthy step forward in diabetes detection. The results emphasize the importance of sophisticated machine learning methods, highlighting how SMKSVM-RF can improve diagnostic precision and aid in the continual advancement of …"

Fish-borne parasites of humans and animals, are dorso-ventrally flattened and hermaphroditic and require one or more intermediate hosts. Fish-borne trematodes have been found in the small intestines of several definitive hosts such as birds, cats, dogs, rats and humans. These hosts were infected by eating raw freshwater fish containing encysted metacercariae. Thus, this study was proposed to urgently investigate the geographic information for the prevalence of fish-borne trematode metacercariae in 10 freshwater stations in the Chi river area in Mahasarakham province of Thailand. Four hundred and twenty samples of freshwater fish from 19 different species were randomly collected and examined for fish-borne trematode metacercaria. The fish were found infected with 3 fish-borne trematode metacercariae, namely; Opisthorchis viverrini, Haplorchis taichui, and Haplorchoides species. The prevalence of fish-borne metacercariae was 28.33%(119\/420), Opisthrochis viverrini 1.67%(7\/420) and the intensity of metacercaria was 0.80 per fish. Our study shows that fish-borne trematode metacercariae are found in a variety of fish species, relating to Opisthorchis viverrini, H. taichui, and Haplorchoides sp.

On-site monitoring can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. Therefore, the use of simulation models has become viable and cost-effective. However, to ensure that the model is capable and reliable to describe hydrologic processes in various hydrologic conditions and to use it as an assessment tool, there is a strong need in testing the model against extensive field measured data for different scales, land use, topography, climate, and soil conditions prior to its application for solving natural resource problems within watersheds. For this reason, the objective of this research was to make an effort to calibrate and validate the surface and subsurface components of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for various hydrologic …"

Annual stream flows measured at the watershed outlet were greatly under-predicted when precipitation data collected within the watershed during the 1999-2001 period were used to drive SWAT. Selection of alternative climate data resulted in greatly improved average annual stream predictions, and also relatively strong r2 values of 0.73 and 0.72 for the predicted average monthly flows and NO3-N loads, respectively. The impact of alternative precipitation data shows that as average annual precipitation increases 19%, the relative change in average annual streamflow is about 55%. In …"

Embedded processors require smaller cache size for low power system-on-a-chip consideration. Decreasing cache size leads to reduced power consumption because a smaller cache has less capacitance from the bit array size as well as smaller drivers in decoder or peripheral circuitry.. Unfortunately, performance also decreases due to a lower cache hit rate when the cache size becomes smaller. Recently, to improve the miss rate on a cache, many prefetching schemes have been introduced. However, on a small cache, prefetching schemes do not perform well because projected data replace the data that a processor will need in the future. This causes cache pollution, which degrades system performance. To overcome the cache pollution on a small cache, the paper introduces a new technique …"

Often designers of modem microprocessors have focused on high speed rather than lowpower dissipation. However, in portable devices, a low-power system design has become an important issue. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the energy of various system components. These include both hardware and software oriented techniques. Many of these efforts [11, 13, 25] have focused on the memory subsystem which has been found to be a major energy consumer of the entire system. For example, on-chip caches of the DEC 21164 microprocessor consume 25% of the total chip power [11], and on-chip caches of modem embedded RISC microprocessors such as the StrongARM SA 110 [17] and the PowerPC from IBM [2 …"

Sugarcane is one of the key industrial crops in Thailand, Brazil, China, and India. Therefore, monitoring sugarcane growth and harvest is important for evaluating yield, optimizing logistic operations, and forecasting crop productivity. To monitor sugarcane growth more effectively and efficiently, this study aimed to classify the sugarcane cultivation regions in Chuenchom District, Maha Sarakham Province, Thailand, using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images. To this end, three algorithms were used for classification: support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and maximum likelihood (ML). A combination of parameter sets using four bands (red, green, blue, and NIR) and two vegetation indices: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was set up for the classification. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values were computed to validate the classification results with visual interpretation of high-resolution images. Results from the study showed that RF outperformed the SVM and ML classification techniques with overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values of 75.93 and 0.616, respectively, for Landsat-8 images and 78.60 and 0.656, respectively, for Sentinel-2 images. Specifically, RF classification with red, green, blue, and NIR provided the highest accuracy for the Landsat-8 images, while RF classification with red, green, blue, and NDVI proved to be the most accurate for the Sentinel-2 images. In summary, both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images have great potential for …"

Therefore, the important tasks for extracting data records from these semi-structured web pages are identifying the relevant data regions and ignoring the irrelevant regions. To figure out the stated problem, This paper proposes a region extractor to be a preprocessor tool for helping an information extractor to locate and extract the relevant data records from web pages. Most existing works analyze the DOM tree of an input page in a top-down manner. In another way, the proposed method traverses the DOM tree in the bottom-up direction that the similarity of the leaf nodes are analyzed prior to find a set of data items …"

This technique was based on the hypothesis that data records in the web page must have a subject item, and the repetitive pattern of the subject items can be used to identify the boundary of data records. The system consists of four automatic tasks: (1) parsing a sample page to a DOM tree, (2) recognizing a subject string in the DOM tree, (3) using the subject string for identifying the pattern of data records and generating a wrapper, and (4) using the generated wrapper for extracting data records. This approach enables the very flexible wrapper generator; when the automatic process generated the wrong wrapper, user can also provide a new sample subject string for generating better wrapper …"

The system then builds a wrapper and extracts the relevant data records automatically. The techniques for the proposed system are a repetitive subject pattern for discovery data records, a subject tree clustering algorithm for clustering target data records, and a subject tree alignment for aligning data items and create an extraction pattern.

In this paper, a new method for the fresh weight estimation of lettuce using a 3D stereoscopic technique was proposed by creating a 3D spatial domain from stereo images. The fresh weight of lettuce was estimated by the sum of the area in each surface layer. The estimated fresh weight (grams) of lettuce was consistent with the actual weight (grams), with a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and an RMSE of 2.42.

Once the drone is assigned a flight mission, it will automatically fly to its destination. The ability to quickly maneuver obstacles is essential to complete the task assigned to it. Obstacle analysis processes need to be efficient and require fewer computing resources due to the hardware and power constraints of drones. This work presents a simple but effective way to detect obstacles using a 3D Stereoscopic camera and a less complicated image processing method, which can run on a small single-board computer. On-site flight tests show that the proposed method can be used efficiently. It can detect obstacles at a distance of 2 meters, 5 frames per second, 79.55% of detection accuracy, and maneuver effectively."

The multipath is the result of sound reflected in the pinna of the human ear before coming into the inner ear. The analysis of the sound multiple frequencies shown that the polynomial model of 1500 Hz has the best result in vertical plane sound localization. The angular error of this model is 8.407 and RMSE is 10.308. Similar results can also be seen from other frequency models that were built in this study. Those results showed that we can localize the sound in the vertical plane using multipath analysis that was recorded using only 1 microphone equipped with the artificial ear."

                "description": "Bile Ducts Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma: CCA) is a serious public health problem. The surgical resection is one of the curative treatments for CCA. The surgical resection in the early stage of the CCA gives a good chance for recovery; therefore, early detection in the surgical resection stage is of a critical importance. Periductal fibrosis (PDF) in the bile duct is one factor which is considered about CCA in Thailand. It can be detected using the liver ultrasound images; however, the liver ultrasound images contain speckle noise which decreases PDF detection performance. This paper proposes a new method for enhancement of bile duct ultrasound image (EBDU). The main idea of the EBDU method is to reduce the speckle noise and enhance clear structures of the liver ultrasound images. The proposed method consists of three processes which are the speckle reduction, edge preservation, and intraregion smoothing. The speckle reduction is performed in frequency domain to filter out the high frequency and low frequency noise out of the ultrasound image by using the bandpass filter. The criterion of the bandpass filter is the size of the structures in the ultrasound image, which could be large structures (mirrored edges) and small structures (smoothing). Edge preservation is then performed by applying the statistics filter to distinctly increase the boundary structure; it sorts out all pixel values from the surrounding neighborhood into a numerical order. Finally, intraregions of the liver ultrasound images are smoothed by intra-region smoothing process which can diffuse the homogeneous region. The enhanced liver ultrasound images were tested by …"

There is also another important property of image captured by a stereo camera; if an object is at a certain position it will appear at a certain combination of location in images from left and right camera but not any other. This property can be used to detect obstacles by checking a number of sample point placed in a grid in front of the drone. For each point we then use the property stated above to check if locations in the image specified by the property matches. We have evaluated the effectiveness of this algorithm.

One of the common problems is class overlap, where the data have a similar instance between classes. The prediction task of customer churn becomes more challenging when there is class overlap in the data training. In this research, we suggested a hybrid method based on tabular GANs, called CTGAN-ENN, to address class overlap and imbalanced data in datasets of customers that churn. We used five different customer churn datasets from an open platform. CTGAN is a tabular GAN-based oversampling to address class imbalance but has a class overlap problem. We combined CTGAN with the ENN under-sampling technique to overcome the class overlap. CTGAN-ENN reduced the number of class overlaps by each feature in all datasets. We investigated how effective CTGAN-ENN is in each machine learning technique. Based on our …"

The goal of this study was to empirically examine the impact of ERP implementation and use on the long-term performance of organizations. This research leverages three fundamental specifications for the examination of impacts as follows: performance ratios (ROA, ROE, ROI, ROS), labor productivity (production function), and stock market valuation (Tobin's Q). This research used a total of six years of financial data from 47 organizations in Thailand that implement and use ERP system. The findings reveal that a post-adoption period of more than four years may be needed in order to observe a significant impact from ERP investments on organizational performance."

Therefore, to investigate the underlying attributes that characterize user interaction with and adaptation to information technology (IT), we collected data from four organizations that had implemented enterprise-wide systems for at least three years prior to commencing fieldwork. By taking a grounded theory approach, we identify four distinct adaptation patterns: reluctant, compliant, faithful, and enthusiastic. These patterns represent configurations of five interrelated attributes that users espouse in their interaction with enterprise-wide systems: attitude towards the system, approach to learning how to use the system, level of interaction with the system, exploration of system features, and stance towards changing work practices. We propose an emergent, substantive theory of IT adaptation patterns that explains the intricate interplay of individual, task, and organizational initiatives in shaping these adaptation patterns."

In this research, we examined patterns of use, the spatiotemporal meanings of work and non-work as well as the emerging perceptions of mobility experiences. Our empirical setting is a university in New Zealand where we collected data from academic and non-academic staff. Our findings confirmed that mobile-enabled work activities interfere with the non-work realm. More importantly, we discovered the mutual influence between spatiotemporal meanings and the use of mobile devices, leading to emerging perceptions of mobility experiences. These perceptions are manifested as unsolved controversies, accommodating attitude, constant agitation and crisscrossing spheres."

Although previous information systems (IS) research provides useful models for understanding individual acceptance, there is a limited understanding of the underlying adaptive process related to IS use, particularly in a mandatory context. This study argues that adaptation is a socially constructed process. Informed by the conceptual elements of coping theory, this study proposes an examination of the adaptive behaviours of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems users. The fieldwork will be conducted in three organisations–one private, one public and one multinational–operating in Thailand. The multiple-case study design allows the scrutiny of contrasting patterns in the data. By taking an interpretive grounded theory approach, this study aims at producing an emergent and substantive theory that explains both the adaptive process and the complex interplay of individual and contextual factors that influences adaptive behaviours over time."

Planners need information on the sustainability and economics of transmission network expansion planning (TNEP). This work presents a newly proposed method for TNEP that considers high-penetration solar energy by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The power sources, thermal and hydropower plants, and conditions of load were set in the account, including an uncertain power source and solar energy (PV). The optimal sizing and locating of the PV to be connected to the network were determined by the PSO. The PV grid code was set in the account. The new line’s investment cost and equipment was analyzed. The PV cost was considered based on the power loss, and the system’s reliability was improved. The IEEE 118 bus test system and Lao PDR’s system were requested to test the proposed practice. The results demonstrate that the proposed TNEP method is robust and feasible. The simulation results will be applied to guide the power system planning of Lao PDR."

The temperature effect on the magnetic properties and the initial angle between the free and pinned layer magnetizations in the MTJ cell are significant for the fast switching process in STT-RAM. In this study, the switching energy was investigated with the temperature effect on the magnetic properties at various initial angles. The results show that the saturation magnetization was decreased by increments of the initial temperature, which also resulted in the reduction of the intrinsic critical current density. Consequently, switching energy can be reduced by the increase of both the initial temperature and the initial angle. Although the initial temperature increment in the MTJ cell is interesting for the fast switching process in …"

The service center agents of each province are reported the notified problems of network devices from the customer service center; the staff, subsequently, are assigned to cope with such failure of network devices. Recently, 2nd service center at KhonKaen has used the Zabbix, an open source program, to monitor the working status of network devices, thus saving time spent on problem-solving and waiting time spent on waiting for the problem notification from the customer service center. The use of the open source Zabbix program enables modulator to rapidly obtain the notification of defects of network devices; however, this operation, which use documents forms to record the repair device information and send it to the others operators (employee), suffers from complicated process and delay. To solve the problem, we developed a web application for notification of network status and assigned task management. The overview of the developed web application consists of two layers. In the backend, the Mongo DB is created as the database which records the status log from Zabbix. In the frontend, developed web application implemented by Node. js get the failure of network devices from Mongo DB and send it as a task to the modulator and operator to fix them.

Immediately, many educators wondered if it was possible to use the chatbot as a support tool that helps students answer their programming questions. This article evaluates this possibility at three levels: fundamental Computer Science knowledge (basic algorithms and data structures), core competency (design patterns), and advanced knowledge (quantum computing). In each case, we ask normalized questions several times to ChatGPT3.5, then look at the correctness of answers, and finally check if this creates issues. The main result is that the performances of ChatGPT3.5 degrades drastically as the specialization of the domain increases: for basic algorithms it returns answers that are almost always correct, for design patterns the generated code contains many code smells and is generally of low quality, but it is still sometimes able to fix it (if asked), and for quantum computing it is often blatantly wrong."

When passing a request or an information from a web application to another system, an extra care is required; otherwise, malicious code might be able to bypass to other trusted systems. SQL injection is a frequently found injection attack against web application vulnerability. The security flaw could be unintentionally included in the source code of a web application during the software development phase. Since each programing language has various ways to respond to a call to external commands and external resources, the best approach to determine if an application has injection vulnerabilities is to analyze its source code to search for all requests to run external commands and calls to external resources.

We applied JOS to the Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), the performance is increased because JOS balances the capability of exploration phase by using SLO and exploitation phase by using DO. The new algorithm, named Harris’ Hawks Optimization-Joint Opposite Selection (HHO-JOS), is also proposed in this research as an enhanced version of HHO to solve single-objective problems.

Those techniques and tools suffer from subjectivity issues, discordant results among the tools, and the reliability of the thresholds. To mitigate these problems, we used machine learning to automate developers’ perception in code smells detection. Different from other existing machine learning used in code smell detection we trained our models with an extensive dataset based on more than 3000 professional reviews on 518 open source projects.

This paper proposed a hybrid data compression algorithm to increase the input data length to be encrypted by RSA. Firstly, a plain text is compressed by the LZW algorithm. The compressed data is padded. After that, the size of the compressed data is further reduced by using continued fraction. Double-compressed data is, then, used as an input of RSA. When using a combination of continued fraction and LZW algorithm, the results showed that, on average, the input data length is increased by 18.91 per cent. In most cases, the processing time is much better than not doing any compression. In the case of decryption, a cipher text is decrypted by RSA first. The padding is removed. Then, the Euclidean algorithm and LZW are used respectively to …"

They have well-established and growing higher education systems, increasingly focused on quality improvement. However, they fall behind regional leaders in educating people who design, develop, deploy and train data science and artificial intelligence (DS&AI) based technology, as evident from the technological market, regionally dominated by Singapore and Malaysia, while the region as a whole is far behind China. A similar situation holds also for Sri Lanka, in the South Asia region technologically dominated by India. In this paper, we describe the design of a master's level curriculum in data science and artificial intelligence using European experience on building such curricula. The design of such a curriculum is a nontrivial exercise because there is a constant trade-off between having a sufficiently broad academic curriculum and adequately meeting regional needs, including those of industrial stakeholders. In fact, findings from a gap analysis and assessment of needs from three case studies in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand comprise the most significant component of our curriculum development process."

This is a report of the mHealth hackathon hosted by Khon Kaen University in collaboration with MIT Sana and faculty members from Harvard Medical School with the aim to improve health care delivery in the Northeast region of Thailand. Key health challenges, such as improving population health literacy, tracking disease trajectory and outcomes among rural communities, and supporting the workflow of overburdened frontline providers, were addressed using mHealth. Many modifications from the usual format of hackathon were made to tailor the event to the local context and culture, such as the process of recruiting participants and how teams were matched and formed. These modifications serve as good learning points for hosting future hackathons. There are also many lessons learned about how to achieve a fruitful collaboration despite cultural barriers, how to best provide mentorship to the participants, how to instill in the participants a sense of mission, and how to match the participants in a fair and efficient manner. This event showcases how interdisciplinary collaboration can produce results that are unattainable by any discipline alone and demonstrates that innovations are the fruits of collective wisdom of people from different fields of expertise who work together toward the same goals."

In the third part, it focused on the separation of damaged seeds by the size, the circle shape and HSV of soybean seeds. From 30 soybean seed images, the percentage of accuracy of counting and separating damaged seeds by naked eyes was 100 percent, and the average time spent was 13.70 seconds. The percentage of accuracy of counting the seeds by the developed program was 100 percent, and the accuracy of the separation of damaged seeds was 99.80 percent.

However, obtaining complete malaria cells for analysis is still a problem because the clarity and the brightness of most images are different. So, there are errors in malaria cell detection. Therefore, this study presented the method for adjusting red blood cell images to the optimum brightness level by improving the partial contrast stretching technique. Then S component in the HSI color space was used to detect the red blood cells infected with the malaria. It was also incorporated with a* component in CIE L*a*b* color space to obtain a complete malaria cell. In the experiment, 52 images of thin blood film were used. The results revealed that the accuracy of the detection of malaria-infected red blood cells from the S component was 80.76 percent while the accuracy of the proposed method in this study was accounted for 98 …"

                "description": "Since the Internet is a large resource of information that is important to a vast number of people, search engines are implemented for accessing the required resources over the Internet. Every search engine allows users to enter keywords in the search field for searching. Unfortunately, searching by keyword is usually not specific. When users do not know appropriate keywords, the search result is generally a long list of information, much of it irrelevant. Therefore, the protocol named Information Search Protocol (ISP) is proposed. The ISP enables users to enter a partial part of the required URL and keywords; the ISP can narrow down the search. However, the original ISP cannot perform an image search and it has a defect of the routing module that causes network congestion. Therefore, this research proposes the image search mechanism and routing algorithm to apply to the ISP. Since the ISP is modified in all mechanisms, the new version of the ISP is called Specific Information Search Protocol (SISP). The image extraction of the image search mechanism is implemented using Color Region Correlation (CRC). Moreover, this research is also proposing a Patrol Packet (PTP) Algorithm to solve the routing problem. The search result of the SISP is specific. In addition to more effective searches, the PTP can significantly reduce the congestion caused. Therefore, the SISP is a performance search protocol."

Currently, many methods are proposed to determine the resource location, such as Flooding algorithm and Random walk. Unfortunately, the performance of these algorithms has some defects that cannot provide a full and correct list that the users’ require. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective search algorithm, called Patrol Packet (PTP) algorithm. PTP was developed under the implementation of the Information Search Protocol (ISP) where the search criteria can be determined. Thus, the results obtained from the PTP algorithm can satisfy users’ requirement with a quick response time. Since the PTP algorithm is obtained from a modification of the flooding algorithm, the number of distributed bytes over the communication channel is reduced when compared to the original algorithm. Consequently, congestion can be minimized. In addition, the performance testing of the PTP shows that this algorithm is suitable for distributed search where a large number of query messages spreads over the communication channel."

Therefore, obtaining an IP address of a host name might spend a long time to search in the hierarchical mode according that the required IP address may exist in a far branch of the naming systems. However, since all naming systems are linked via communication channels. Therefore, instead of using the hierarchical search, this paper proposed a network search algorithm, called patrol packet algorithm (PTPA). This algorithm can shorten the search time for IP address from the naming database system. Thus, the response time to access the destination from any sources is small comparing to the hierarchical search mechanism implemented in any existing naming systems."

It is crucial to identify positive cases as rapidly as humanely possible to provide appropriate treatment for patients and prevent the pandemic from spreading further. Both chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images are capable of accurately diagnosing COVID-19. To distinguish lung illnesses (i.e., COVID-19 and pneumonia) from normal cases using chest X-ray and CT images, we combined convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) models by replacing the fully connected layers of CNN with a version of RNN. In this framework, the attributes of CNNs were utilized to extract features and those of RNNs to calculate dependencies and classification base on extracted features. CNN models VGG19, ResNet152V2, and DenseNet121 were combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNN models, which are convenient to develop because these networks are all available as features on many platforms. The proposed method is evaluated using a large dataset totaling 16,210 X-ray and CT images (5252 COVID-19 images, 6154 pneumonia images, and 4804 normal images) were taken from several databases, which had various image sizes, brightness levels, and viewing angles. Their image quality was enhanced via normalization, gamma correction, and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization.

The image was acquired by a webcam camera that connected to the computer and then rescaled. The image was then converted to grayscale and noise was reduced using a Gaussian blur filter. Otsu's Binarization is used to convert the image to binary. The binary image is then subjected to morphological operations. Following that, using the Watershed Algorithm, separate the egg's overlapped area. Finally, the prepared image is ready to be counted using the contour matrix method. This method independently classifies each egg segmentation and can count up to 18 eggs per frame with a processing time of less than 1 second."

Then, we compared classification accuracy and performance using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the squared mean error (Root Mean Square Error: RMSE), and discovered that the Gaussian RBF kernel of the SVM algorithm model is more accurate than the other model.

In this study, we exploit an image alignment approach based on a geometric invariant, which is the area spanned by feature-point triplets for personal identification. First, we located the optic disc by using a projection of the vascular structure in vascular extraction and extracted feature points that are bifurcations of a retinal blood vessel in the vicinity of the optic disc as the landmarks. Delaunay triangulation is then applied to the extracted feature points. The absolute invariant is then derived by taking the ratio of successive triangular area patches. The alignment is achieved by establishing correspondences between feature points after a conformal sorting step based on a derived set of absolute affine invariants. The affine transformation parameters can then be calculated by the corresponding vertices of the most robust neighbouring triangle of both inquiry and reference images. The optic disc localization results successfully located 95.95% in six widely used retinal image databases. The algorithm of vascular extraction, applied on the DRIVE database, provided an average accuracy of approximately 94.1%. The best accuracy and sensitivity for neighbouring triangle matching obtained were 99.90% and 87.66%, respectively."

The capability of multitask learning to simultaneously acquire knowledge from numerous related tasks, leveraging shared information and inter-dependencies, leads to considerable performance boosts. Integrated into this process is the feature guideline learning task, which empowers the model to have an attention to abnormal areas. This task is initially trained on a small collection of labeled images to develop a custom pre-trained model, which later forms the basis for subsequent classification tasks.

There is the need of study for factors effecting these accidents. In this work, we applied feature selection and classification techniques for analyzing important factors causing road accidents on the dataset of motorcycle accidents. In particular, the experiment compared the performance of K-Nearest Neighbor classification models trained from (i) dataset with all features and (ii) dataset with selected features from the Wrapper technique. It was found that there was no significant difference, so the selected features could represent the models that were similar to the original ones. These selected features are …"

Using a suitable number of clusters is one of the most important factors to influence the performance of clustering. Several algorithms of cluster validation have been developed to find such a number. In this paper, we proposed a method for cluster validation adapted from the Discrimination Evaluation via Optic Diffraction Analysis (DEODA) algorithm to derive an appropriate number of clusters. In particular, our method uses DEODA to perform within- and between-cluster discrimination analysis in order to find the suitable number of clusters. We evaluate our method by comparing similarity score against the existing cluster validation algorithm i.e., the Silhouette index. The results show that the similarity scores derived from our method are higher than results yielded from the Silhouette index."

An important process and key to success is the feature extraction which requires a lot of data and time for learning. Deep learning has proven to be an outstanding method for extracting relevant features of image classification when a huge amount of data is available. However, it is not an easy task for face recognition, which consists of a small number of images per person considered as classes. This paper applies the idea of transferred learning for feature extraction to a face recognition application. The feature extraction part of the trained deep learning model from a different domain is transferred for extracting face features. Then, the multilayer perceptron neural network is used for model evaluation. Experimental results on public face databases show that the proposed method is highly efficient."

Their primary aim is to improve the quality of life of the citizens by providing intelligent services in a wide variety of aspects like transportation, healthcare, entertainment, environment, and energy. In order to provide such services, the role of big-data and its analysis is extremely important as it enables to obtain valuable insights into the large data generated by the smart-cities. In this article, we investigate the state-of-art research efforts directed towards big-data analytics in a smart-city context. Specifically, first we present a big-data centric taxonomy for the smart-cities to bring forth a generic overview of the importance of big-data paradigm in a smart-city environment. This is followed by the presentation of a top-level snapshot of the commonly used big-data analytical platforms. Due to the heterogeneity of data being collected by the smart-cities, often with conflicting processing requirements, suitable analytical techniques depending upon the data type are also suggested. In addition to this, a generic four-tier big-data framework comprising of the sensing hub, storage hub, processing hub and application hub is also proposed that can be applied in any smart-city context. This is complemented by providing the common big-data applications in a smart-city and presentation of ten selected case studies of smart-cities across the globe. Finally, the open challenges are highlighted in order to give future research directions."

In this study, we propose a systematic framework for financial information mining that actively considers the interaction among traditional financial ratios and cash flow signaling in identifying stocks that outperform the average market return in the arriving period. Association detection method is adopted to ensure the mined rules be reliable and practical. The experimental results show that cash flow is a needed integral component in all mined rules that effectively indicate outranked stocks."

A discrete wavelet transform is employed to decompose the cough sound into low frequency and high frequency components. The statistical features of these components are used as the sound features. The discrimination power of these features in classification are evaluated. Finally, the artificial neural network is used to classify dog cough sound using a subset of discriminant features. The experimental results show that classifying dog cough sounds needs only one fourth of all features and an average accuracy as high as 90% is achievable."

While TM in metabolic domain has been attempted previously, it is still challenging due to variety of specific terms and their meanings in different contexts. Named Entity Recognition (NER) generally used to identify interested keyword (protein and metabolite terms) in sentence, this preliminary task therefore highly influences the performance of metabolic TM framework. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) NER has been actively used during a last decade, because it explicitly outperforms other approaches. However, an efficient CRFs-based NER depends purely on a quality of corpus which is a nontrivial task to produce. This paper introduced a hybrid solution which combines CRFs-based NER, dictionary usage, and complementary modules (constructed from …"

It accurately defines the priority level of each service case. The presence of imbalanced datasets in service cases poses a challenge for achieving reliable classification accuracy. To address this, the use of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was proposed as the method for balancing the datasets prior to applying the ML method. From these experimental results, an improvement in the precision of the learning process was observed, which led to better outcomes in the test sets. This improvement was measured using the efficiency metrics from the confusion matrix. The experiment involved 6,182 service cases, categorized into four levels: critical, serious, moderate, and low. These were based on test comparisons with other ML methods. The accuracy achieved in the test data was 94.37%. By employing a hybrid technique to address the imbalance in SMOTE and the support vector machine model, it was found to be more effective than the comparative term frequency-inverse document frequency model that was used in conjunction with cosine similarity, which achieved an evaluation score of 70.14%."

They provide people with the ability to write reviews about their experience with respect to service quality, location, room, and cleanliness, thereby helping others before booking hotels. Many people fail to consider hotel bookings because the numerous reviews take a long time to read, and many are in a non-native language. Thus, hotel businesses need an efficient process to analyze and categorize the polarity of reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. In particular, low-resource languages such as Thai have greater limitations in terms of resources to classify sentiment polarity. In this paper, a sentiment analysis method is proposed for Thai sentiment classification in the hotel domain. Firstly, the Word2Vec technique (the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) and skip-gram approaches) was applied to create word embeddings of different vector dimensions. Secondly, each word embedding model was combined with deep learning (DL) models to observe the impact of each word vector dimension result. We compared the performance of nine DL models (CNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, Bi-GRU, CNN-LSTM, CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-GRU, and CNN-BiGRU) with different numbers of layers to evaluate their performance in polarity classification. The dataset was classified using the FastText and BERT pre-trained models to carry out the sentiment polarity classification. Finally, our experimental results show that the WangchanBERTa model slightly improved the accuracy, producing a value of 0.9225, and the skip-gram and CNN model combination outperformed other …"

This research uses a vision-based technique on a complex background with semantic segmentation performed with dilated convolution for hand segmentation, hand strokes separated using optical flow, and learning feature and classification done with convolution neural network (CNN). We then compared the five CNN structures that define the formats. The first format was used to set the number of filters to 64 and the size of the filter to 3 × 3 with 7 layers; the second format used 128 filters, each filter 3 × 3 in size with 7 layers; the third format used the number of filters in ascending order with 7 layers, all of which had an equal 3 × 3 filter size; the fourth format determined the number of filters in ascending order and the size of the filter based on a small size with 7 layers; the final format was a structure based on AlexNet. As a result, the average accuracy was 88.83%, 87.97%, 89.91%, 90.43%, and 92.03%, respectively.

                "description": "Sign language is a type of language for the hearing impaired that people in the general public commonly do not understand. A sign language recognition system, therefore, represents an intermediary between the two sides. As a communication tool, a multi‑stroke Thai finger‑spelling sign language (TFSL) recognition system featuring deep learning was developed in this study. This research uses a vision‑based technique on a complex background with semantic segmentation per‑formed with dilated convolution for hand segmentation, hand strokes separated using optical flow, and learning feature and classification done with convolution neural network (CNN). We then com‑pared the five CNN structures that define the formats. The first format was used to set the number of filters to 64 and the size of the filter to 3× 3 with 7 layers; the second format used 128 filters, each filter 3× 3 in size with 7 layers; the third format used the number of filters in ascending order with 7 layers, all of which had an equal 3× 3 filter size; the fourth format determined the number of filters in ascending order and the size of the filter based on a small size with 7 layers; the final format was a structure based on AlexNet. As a result, the average accuracy was 88.83%, 87.97%, 89.91%, 90.43%, and 92.03%, respectively. We implemented the CNN structure based on AlexNet to create models for multi‑stroke TFSL recognition systems. The experiment was performed using an isolated video of 42 Thai alphabets, which are divided into three categories consisting of one stroke, two strokes, and three strokes. The results presented an 88.00% average accuracy for one stroke, 85.42 …"

In conventional parametric speech synthesis, F0 is predicted frame-by-frame. This method is insufficient to represent F0 contours in larger units, especially tone contours of syllables in tonal languages that deviate as a result of long-term context dependency. This work proposes a syllable-level F0 model that represents F0 contours within syllables, using syllable-level F0 parameters that comprise the sampling F0 points and dynamic features. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) was used to represent the relationships between syllable-level contextual features and syllable-level F0 parameters. The proposed model was examined using an Isarn speech synthesis system with both large and small training sets. For all training sets, the results of objective and subjective tests indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline systems based on hidden Markov models and DNNS that predict F0 values at the frame level."

Sampled values of F0 are used at the syllable level of continuous Isarn speech combined with their dynamic features to represent supra-segmental properties of the F0 contour. Different architectures of the deep RNNs and different combinations of linguistic features are analyzed to obtain conditions for the best performance. To assess the proposed method, we compared it with several RNN-based baselines.

This paper proposed a hybrid data compression algorithm to increase the input data length to be encrypted by RSA. Firstly, a plain text is compressed by the LZW algorithm. The compressed data is padded. After that, the size of the compressed data is further reduced by using continued fraction. Double-compressed data is, then, used as an input of RSA. When using a combination of continued fraction and LZW algorithm, the results showed that, on average, the input data length is increased by 18.91 per cent. In most cases, the processing time is much better than not doing any compression. In the case of decryption, a cipher text is decrypted by RSA first. The padding is removed. Then, the Euclidean algorithm and LZW are used respectively to …"

We present, herein, a Thai finger-spelling sign language recognition system (TFSLR) used to classify alphabets shown in similar gestures. Five signers postured fifteen Thai alphabet characters, in which images were taken in five repetitions, totaling 375 finger-spelling images. Our experiment utilizes five-fold cross-validation in order to evaluate the projected system effectiveness. Additionally, we compared the results of each experiment involving PHOG with the amalgamation of PHOG and the local features.

It accurately defines the priority level of each service case. The presence of imbalanced datasets in service cases poses a challenge for achieving reliable classification accuracy. To address this, the use of the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was proposed as the method for balancing the datasets prior to applying the ML method. From these experimental results, an improvement in the precision of the learning process was observed, which led to better outcomes in the test sets. This improvement was measured using the efficiency metrics from the confusion matrix. The experiment involved 6,182 service cases, categorized into four levels: critical, serious, moderate, and low. These were based on test comparisons with other ML methods. The accuracy achieved in the test data was 94.37%. By employing a hybrid technique to address the imbalance in SMOTE and the support vector machine model, it was found to be more effective than the comparative term frequency-inverse document frequency model that was used in conjunction with cosine similarity, which achieved an evaluation score of 70.14%."

Extreme learning machine (ELM) with kernel is an efficient method for solving both regression and multi-class classification problems. However, ELM with kernel has a limitation when it comes to multi-label classification tasks. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an enhanced ELM with kernel based on a fuzzy set theory for multi-label classification problems. The relationship between an instance and its corresponding class can be defined as the fuzzy membership. This fuzzy membership is used in output weights computation to weigh the training sample towards the corresponding classes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the ELM family of algorithms for multi-label problems, as well as the state-of-the-art multi-label …"

To overcome this limitation, we propose a metaheuristic-based learning algorithm for building an ensemble system, resulting in shorter training time. In our proposed method, a master-slave based metaheuristic algorithm is employed in the optimization process to produce a group of heterogeneous feedforward neural networks, in which the global search operations are executed on the master, and the tasks of objective evaluation are distributed to the slaves (workers).

Firstly, the most important contribution is on the investigation of the most appropriate unit of an input sequence for the neural sequence-to-sequence Thai TTS. We found that the system with phoneme input was superior to the system with character input. Secondly, We explored the benefits of the word and\/or syllable boundaries information in both character-based and phoneme-based. We found that word delimiting can improve the naturalness of the synthesized speech. This means word segmentation is considered a necessary step for text processing tasks in neural sequence-to-sequence Thai TTS. Finally, we explored our TTS system in the real setting. Our results indicated that the neural TTS using ground truth or predicted input features for phoneme-based can generate a high-quality synthesized speech at the same level."

In conventional parametric speech synthesis, F0 is predicted frame-by-frame. This method is insufficient to represent F0 contours in larger units, especially tone contours of syllables in tonal languages that deviate as a result of long-term context dependency. This work proposes a syllable-level F0 model that represents F0 contours within syllables, using syllable-level F0 parameters that comprise the sampling F0 points and dynamic features. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) was used to represent the relationships between syllable-level contextual features and syllable-level F0 parameters. The proposed model was examined using an Isarn speech synthesis system with both large and small training sets. For all training sets, the results of objective and subjective tests indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline systems based on hidden Markov models and DNNS that predict F0 values at the frame level."

Sampled values of F0 are used at the syllable level of continuous Isarn speech combined with their dynamic features to represent supra-segmental properties of the F0 contour. Different architectures of the deep RNNs and different combinations of linguistic features are analyzed to obtain conditions for the best performance. To assess the proposed method, we compared it with several RNN-based baselines.

                "description": "Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a crucial role in understanding human emotions and is becoming increasingly relevant in educational contexts, where personalized and empathetic interactions are essential. The problems with existing approaches are typically solved using a single deep learning method, which is not robust with complex datasets, such as FER data, which have a characteristic imbalance and multi-class labels. In this research paper, an innovative approach to FER using a homogeneous ensemble convolutional neural network, called HoE-CNN, is presented for future online learning education. This paper aims to transfer the knowledge of models and FER classification using ensembled homogeneous conventional neural network architectures. FER is challenging to research because there are many real-world applications to consider, such as adaptive user interfaces, games, education, and robot integration. HoE-CNN is used to improve the classification performance on an FER dataset, encompassing seven main multi-classes (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral). The experiment shows that the proposed framework, which uses an ensemble of deep learning models, performs better than a single deep learning model. In summary, the proposed model will increase the efficiency of FER classification results and solve FER2013 at a accuracy of 75.51%, addressing both imbalanced datasets and multi-class classification to transfer the application of the model to online learning applications."

Product shelf renovation is a crucial process that can increase supermarket efficiency. The development of a sequential pattern mining algorithm for investigating the correlation patterns of product layouts, solving the numerous problems of shelf design, and the development of an algorithm that considers in-store purchase and shelf profit data with the goal of improving supermarket efficiency, and consequently profitability, were the goals of this research. The authors of this research developed two types of algorithms to enhance efficiency and reach the goals. The first was a PrefixSpan algorithm, which was used to optimize sequential pattern mining, known as the PrefixSpan mining approach. The second was a new multi-objective design that considered the objective functions of profit volumes and closeness rating using the mutation-based harmony search (MBHS) optimization algorithm, which was used to evaluate the performance of the first algorithm based on the PrefixSpan algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the PrefixSpan algorithm can determine correlation rules more efficiently and accurately ascertain correlation rules better than any other algorithms used in the study. Additionally, the authors found that MBHS with a new multi-objective design can effectively find the product layout in supermarket solutions. Finally, the proposed product layout algorithm was found to lead to higher profit volumes and closeness ratings than traditional shelf layouts, as well as to be more efficient than other algorithms."

However, Thailand still lacks analysis and prediction tools required to prepare for future epidemic situations. Therefore, we present development models for predicting the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the application of a long short-term memory (LSTM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was investigated to predict new cases, total cases, new deaths, and total deaths. There are a total of 77 provinces in Thailand. The data used in this trial were obtained from the Department of Disease Control (DDC) of the Thai government. The modeling employed 2 types of data: dynamic (time series) and static. There were 2 phases: 1) the LSTM was used to manipulate time series data and 2) the MLP model was used to manipulate static data. Then, the models were merged for further analysis. We evaluated the performance of the combined model, yielding an accuracy of 99.72% based on R 2 values, higher than the values obtained for state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the prediction results can be further combined with GIS data in each province and displayed via an easy-to-use web application for mapping."

Redundant image information can be compressed using traditional compression techniques at the cost of considerable energy consumption. Fortunately, compressed sensing (CS) has been introduced as a low-complexity coding scheme for WMSNs. However, the storage and processing of CS-generated images and measurement matrices require substantial memory. Block compressed sensing (BCS) can mitigate this problem. Nevertheless, allocating a fixed sampling to all blocks is impractical since each block holds different information. Although solutions such as adaptive block compressed sensing (ABCS) exist, they lack robustness across various types of images. As a solution, we propose a holistic WMSN architecture for image transmission that performs well on diverse images by leveraging saliency and standard deviation features. A fuzzy logic system (FLS) is then used to determine the appropriate features when allocating the sampling, and each corresponding block is resized using CS. The combined FLS and BCS algorithms are implemented with smoothed projected Landweber (SPL) reconstruction to determine the convergence speed. The experiments confirm the promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared with that of conventional and state-of-the-art algorithms."

Similar to VRP, CVRP is an NP-Hard problem; finding the optimal solution is difficult, especially with large amounts of data. In other words, the problem cannot be solved using a traditional approach because of the high cost of such an approach, ie, high computational time. Thus, this research considers the possibility of integrating a variety of crossover methodologies into an artificial bee colony (ABC) as a heuristic approach to identifying a candidate for a CVRP solver. The research also optimizes ABC to obtain a better solution, rapidly, given time constraint, considering the effectiveness of randomness and precision enhancements related to both the crossover route and path diversity. The practicality of the proposal was evaluated by pitting fourteen well-known datasets against a traditional method, including other state-of-the-art CVRP heuristic solutions, and the performance improvement was confirmed in terms of both accuracy (ie, finding the best solution) and the computational time as tradeoff."

There are four key modules in our framework: 1) Traffic Generator, 2) SDN Controller, 3. Mininet (Openflow enabled switch), and 4) Alert. To enhance the DDoS detection precision, we also propose the use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a combination of Decision Tree (DT), called GA-DT. The implementation is based on Mininet as SDN emulator. To confirm our superiority, we practically used the real-trace of the four recent DDoSs, i.e., TCP SYN Flood, UDP Flooding, ICMP Flooding, and TCPKill, captured from Wireshark, with our hybrid classification against the existing ones including DT, Logistic Regression (LR), Neural network (NN), Self-organizing map (SOM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and …"

The study area, Huai Bang Sai, Muk Dahan Province, located in Northeast Thailand and covers an area of about 1382 km2. The objective of this study was to estimate soil erosion as a result of expanding rubber tree plantation with the use of satellite data and the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE).

Spatially accurate and reliable information on the rubber tree plantation is needed for better formulating strategic land use planning and understanding its consequences on ecosystem. The study aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for mapping different age groups of rubber tree distribution in the northeast, based on Thaichote satellite data. We used the Thaichote multispectral bands, NDVI and principal component transformation as input parameters. A maximum likelihood method was used to allocate of pixels into the different tree age classes. A transformed divergence was applied to evaluate the training sets of the different age rubber trees and diverse land cover types. The validation was carried out using the Thaichote panchromatic imagery and ground investigation. The mature rubber stands of more than 10 years old could not be differentiated from the evergreen forest. The young rubber tree plantation, paddy land and field crop could not be resolved when using the multispectral imagery. The Thaichote panchromatic imagery is capable of resolving the rubber stands spacing normally 4× 6 m to 5× 7 m. that allows for better discriminating the young rubber from other land cover types. The methodology for mapping the rubber tree plantation includes an analysis of satellite–vegetation indices, supervised classification, supplemented with visual analysis of the panchromatic imagery."

                "description": "Agricultural land use of the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) is being rapidly reshaped by expansion of rubber tree plantation. This occurrence, which has been progressed at an increasing rate in the last three decades, has had consequences for surface water hydrology, degraded ecosystems and loss of paddy land, and has accelerated the processes of drought and flooding. The ensuing scarcity of land has led to the plantation encroachment on legal forest reserve and paddy land marginally unsuitable for rubber tree. The study aims to address the encroachment areas of the rubber tree plantation on the forest reserve of government land and on the paddy field. The study area, a portion of northeast Thailand in the GMS, covers an area of approximately 1.7 million ha and is characterized by gently undulating topography. The methodology procedure comprised an analysis of imagery for land cover\/land use (LCLU), a comparison of LCLU changes and spatial and quantitative identification of the expansion of the rubber tree plantation. The 2002 aerial orthophotography and 2011 THAICHOTE imagery were used to derive LCLU on which the changes and expansion areas were analyzed. Spatial and quantitative information on the rubber tree expansion areas and its change rate was derived from an overlay of the conservation forest (CF) and paddy field layers on the 2002 and 2011 LCLU maps. The total plantation area increased from 42,411.75 ha in 2002 to 288,550 ha in 2011 with its average expansion rate of 27,348.694 ha\/annum (155.08%). Of the total plantation area, the plantation encroachment on the legal forest reserve shared about …"

Spatial information on the rubber plantation areas can be effectively incorporated into land use planning and decision-making. The study aims to establish a spatial database of the rubber plantation areas with the different tree ages using THEOS data. Covering an area of approximately 4339 km 2, Mukdahan province located in the Northeast is currently the area of study. THEOS panchromatic images acquired during the period 2009-2011 were used to identify the plantation areas. Through a process of on-screen digitizing for selected images, textures of the images were based on visual analysis. Using the textures, identification of different tree ages was possible, and distinct line spacing of rubber tree pattern could …"

Spatial information about the planted areas over the Northeast can be incorporated into effective land use planning and decision-making. The study aims to estimate the areas planted to rubber tree, based on an integration of satellite, climate, land form and soil data and to quantify the economic return for the rubber plantation. We used SPOT and THEOS data acquired during the period 2006-2009, covering the entire Northeast which has an area of about 170,000 sq. km. On screen digitization of images was performed, based on visual analysis under the consideration of rainfall, landform and soil data, which simultaneously superimpose on the images. Differentiation and classification of rubber tree was derived from the difference in the cover patterns, resulting 3 classes of the tree age: less than 5, 5-10 and over 10 years. In addition to identifying the planted areas, the main drivers in the rubber plantation were analyzed, based on relevant land qualities and cost-benefit ratio of rubber products. The result indicated that areas planted to rubber tree accounting for about 1,480.19, 384.25, and 379.36 km 2 for< 5, 5-10 and> 10 years of plant ages respectively. The ground truth survey was performed and used for Kappa statistic. With this finding, the integration of satellite and physical data offer reliable estimation of rubber plantation areas. We present rubber plantation areas for the Northeast and the main drivers in expanding the rubber planted areas. Moreover, GIS database …"
